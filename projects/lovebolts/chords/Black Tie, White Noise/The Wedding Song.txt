I really like this song - a lot of layers on top of a very simple round of chords and a distinctive bass.

Basically a D-chord with a Gb basis, an A-chord with an E basis, and a B-chord also with an E basis:

|D|D|A|A|B|B|A|A| etc. etc. In the middle of the song, a variant pops up: 
Bb|Bb|A|A|Bb|Bb|A|A| then back to:
|D|D|A|A| etc.etc.

I donÂ´t know how to write it properly - perhaps someone else does.
