You've got your mother in a whirl 
D                          E
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
D              E
Hey babe, your hair's alright
D               E
Hey babe, let's go out tonight

You like me, and I like it all

We like dancing and we look divine

       D                     E
You've torn your dress, your face is a mess
    D                      E
You can't get enough, but enough ain't the test
               D                      E
You've got your transmission and your live wire
             D              E
You got your cue line and a handful of ludes
          D                  E
You wanna be there when they count up the dudes
      D              E
And I love your dress
         D               E
You're a juvenile success
             D             E
Because your face is a mess
   D                  E
So how could they know
        D                  E
I said, how could they know
            D
So what you wanna know
  E                          D
Calamity's child, chi-chile, chi-chile
                  E
Where'd you wanna go
           D
What can I do for you
                  E
Looks like you've been there too
             D              E
Cause you've torn your dress
         D             E
And your face is a mess
         D             E
Oo, your face is a mess
           D                  E
Oo, oo, so how could they know
        D                  E
Ha, ha, how could they know 
      D  E  D
Ha, ha
