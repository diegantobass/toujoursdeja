Bm           G
  I've never sailed on a sea
Bm           E
  I would not challenge a giant
Bm        G
  I could not take on the church
Bm
Time will crawl
         E
Till the 21st century lose

Bm       G
  I know a government man
Bm               A
  He was as blind as the moon and he
Bm           G
  He saw the sun in the night
Bm          A
  He took a top-gun pilot nad he
Bm            G
  He made him fly thru a hole
Bm            A
  Till he grew real old an he
Bm            G
  And he never came down
Bm        E
  He just flew till he burst

CHORUS:

           Bm
Time will crawl
              G
Till our mouths run dry
           Bm
Time will crawl
         A
Till our feet grow small
           Bm
Time will crawl
          G
Till our tails fall off
           Bm
Time will crawl
          A
Till the 21st century lose

Bm G Bm A

VERSE:
I saw a black black stream
Full of white eyed fish
And a drowning man
With no eyes at all
I felt a warm warm breeze
That melted metal and steel and
I got a bad migraine
That lasted three long years and a
And the pills that I took
Made my fingers disappear

CHORUS:
Time will crawl
Time will crawl
Time will crawl
Till the 21st century lose

Yo
Time will crawl
Time will crawl

You were a talented child
You came to live in our town
We never bothered to scream
When your mask went off
We only smelt the gas
As we lay down to sleep

Time will crawl and our heads bowed down
Time will crawl and our eyes fell out
Time will crawl and the streets run red
Time will crawl till the 21st century lose
Time will crawl and our mouths run dry
Time will crawl and our feet grow small
Time will crawl and our tails fall off
Time will crawl till the 21st century lose
Time will crawl and our heads bowed down
Time will crawl and our eyes fall out
Time will crawl and the streets run red
Time will crawl till the 21st century lose

Time will crawl
For the crazy child
Time will crawl
We'll give every life
Time will crawl
For the crackpot notion
Till the 21st century loose
Time will crawl
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
Till the 21st century loose
