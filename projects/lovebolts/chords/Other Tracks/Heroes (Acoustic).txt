Hey, I just bought a CD of Bowie unplugged.
It has a fantastic acoustic version of Heroes :¬)
Bowie's changed the chords for this version , so here you go..

Heroes Acoustic
Transcribed by Alan Hyde
 A        D
I, I will be king
   A             D
And you, you will be queen
  G                       A
Though nothing will drive them away
     Em          Bm           A
We can beat them, just for one day
            G     D           A
We can be Heroes, just for one day
    A              D
And you, you can be mean
    A              D
And I, I'll drink all the time
    A                       D
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
    A                        D
Yes we're lovers, and that is that
    G                      A
Though nothing, will keep us together
                Em  Bm          A
We could steal time, just for one day
           G      D           A
We can be Heroes, for ever and ever
What d'you say?

Etc Etc and so on :¬)

I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim
Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
We can beat them, for ever and ever
Oh we can be Heroes, just for one day

I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be Heroes, just for one day
We can be us, just for one day

I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing, by the wall (by the wall)
And the guns, shot above our heads (over our heads)
And we kissed, as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)
And the shame, was on the other side
Oh we can beat them, for ever and ever
Then we could be Heroes, just for one day

We can be Heroes
We can be Heroes
We can be Heroes
Just for one day
We can be Heroes

We're nothing, and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer, just for one day

Oh-oh-oh-ohh, oh-oh-oh-ohh
