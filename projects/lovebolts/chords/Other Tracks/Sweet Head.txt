SWEET HEAD 


INTRO:  A  A6  A  A6...see tab


I tried to break away from you 
From the spics and blacks and the gum you chew
Where the posters are torn by the muggin' gangs
By the faggy park and the burnt out vans
         E                    A
I've got ninety-nine years of laying in the dark 
        E                A
And I'm far too young to lie
         E                   A
I've got ninety-nine ways to play my guitar
              E               A
It's going to pay me before I die


CHORUS 1:
   E                             A
So bob your sweet head, Brother, Ziggy gonna play 
    E                           A
I'm just about the best you can hear
      E                        A
Gonna rock it in your head, Shazam and come ball
        E                        A
With my guitar and Mr Fag we can give you sweet head

E  A  E  A  E  A

INTRO


I'm tough as glass and clean as night
Well if looks can love we can love all right
I'm your rubber peacock angelic whore
I'm a wrought iron face upon the wall, ye-owh
      E                    A
I had ninety-nine years of murder-come-life
        E                    A
And I'm running away from it all
E                      A
I got a bedroom, every mirror in town 
                 E             A
They're going to claim me if I fall


CHORUS 2

INTRO


Bm                      G
See my eyes of blocked emotion
Bm                     D
See my tremble, see my fall
    G                D          G        D      A
Traumatics thick and fast, your faith in me can last
  E
Besides I'm known to lay you, one and all


INTRO


Look south the way your mother dwells
If she knew what's going down, she'd give you hell
I'm the kind of man she warned me of
Till there was rock, you only had God
E                A
You and I have a mutual vow
   E                       A
We both like young, and we both like loud
      E                     A
I got pretty shoes, and I'm kid and proud
    E                       A
I'm street side out with my ear to the crowd
