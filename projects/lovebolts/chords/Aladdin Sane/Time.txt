TIME from Aladdin Sane 


INTRO:  Em  Em7  F  C


Em                                                    F
Time he's waiting in the wings he speaks of senseless things
                      C    Am
His script is you and me boys
Em                                               F
Time he flexes like a whore falls wanking to the floor
                     C    Am
His trick is you and me, boy
C#dim7                      Dm     C       C9         F
Time in Quaaludes and red wine demanding Billy Dolls
                     D                  C
And other friends of mine take your time
           C/B         Am G           F
The sniper in the brain regurgitating drain
  D/F#         G                   C         C/B
Incestuous and vain and many other last names
  Am                       G          F                D/F#       G
I look at my watch it says 9:25 and I think Oh God I'm still alive
                   C   C/B  Am
We should be on by now
   G               F   D/F#
We should be on by now
G
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la


Em
You are not a victim you just scream with boredom
F                    C
You are not evicting time


SOLO:  Em  F  C


C#dim7                         Dm         C          C9          F
Chimes Goddamn you're looking old you'll freeze and catch a cold
                               D                   C
'Cause you've left your coat behind take your time
         C/B   Am       G               F
Breaking up is hard but keeping dark is hateful
  D/F#        G                    C
I had so many dreams I had so many breakthroughs
           C/B       Am       G                 F
But you my love were kind but love has left you dreamless
    D/F#               G                         C
The door to dreams was closed your path was real dreamless
               C/B     Am  G                    F
Perhaps you're smiling now smiling through this darkness
    D/F#         G                           C
But all I had to give was guilt for dreaming
C/B Am   G               F   D/F#  G                   C
      We should be on by now        We should be on by now
C/B Am   G               F   D/F#  G                   C
      We should be on by now        We should be on by now
C/B Am   G               F   D/F#
      We should be on by now
G
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Yeah, time!
