Intro E D E D A 

 E                                 D                    E
She had an horror of rooms she was tired you can't hide beat
E                                   D               E
When I looked in her eyes they were blue but nobody home

E                                 D                    E 
She could've been a killer if she didn't walk the way she do, and she do
E                                  D           E
She opened strange doors that we'd never close again

 E                 D
She began to wail jealousies scream
 C                    G          A   E
Waiting at the light know what I mean

CHORUS 
   B
  Scary monsters, super creeps

                   A
  Keep me running, running scared
 B
  Scary monsters, super creeps

                   A              D
  Keep me running, running scared
 (Continue as above)

She asked me to stay and I stole her room
She asked for my love and I gave her a dangerous mind
Now she's stupid in the street and she can't socialise
Well I love the little girl and I'll love her till the day she dies

She wails
Jimmy's guitar sound jealousies scream
Waiting at the light know what I mean

CHORUS 
CHORUS
E                        A                 D               B
Ooooooooooooooh Oh Oh Oh Ooooooooooh Oh Oh Oooooooooooh Oh Ooooooh
