FUTURE LEGEND from Diamond Dogs 

And in the death as the last few corpses lay rotting on the slimy thoroughfare
The shutters lifted in inches in Temperance Building high on Poacher's Hill
And red mutant eyes gaze down on Hunger City
        C
No more big wheels
                                 F
Fleas the size of rats sucked on rats the size of cats
                           F#    G
And ten thousand peoploids split into small tribes
             G#                        Am
Coveting the highest of the sterile skyscrapers
                     G                                   C
Like packs of dogs assaulting the glass fronts of Loveme Avenue
                       D                     G
Ripping and rewrapping mink and shiny silver fox, now legwarmers
                                     C
Family badge of sapphire and cracked emerald any day now the year of the Diamond Dogs...

NOTES:
I done my best with this one but there's so much noise going on it's very 
difficult to hear quite what is going on!
