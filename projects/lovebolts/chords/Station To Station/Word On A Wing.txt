 You say we're growing, growing heart and soul

Don't have to question everything in heaven or hell

Lord, I kneel and offer you my word on a wing
         F              F7              A               A7
And I'm trying hard to fit among your scheme of things
      Dm                                E
It's safer than a strange land, but I still care for myself

And I don't stand in my own light
G     D                             A         G    D

My prayer flies like a word on a wing

         B                       E                     
just as long as I can see, I'll never stop this vision flowing
F#                                 B/F# F#
I look twice and you're still flowing

Sweet name, you're born once again for me

And I'm ready to shape the scheme of things
