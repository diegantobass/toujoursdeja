B side to the CD single Slowburn

By Alan Hyde
 

A          E           C#m                     
There's a man back a-ways
     A                 E
Who believes at where he is 

     A        E
And there's a girl
   G#m                 B
Up ahead who says she knows
         
           A      G#m  
And the street overflows
          C#m            B
With the folk who understand
            E       G#m       B
But for the guy who can't be seen
                A  G#m F#m
He's the Shadow Man
 B             A               E
And the Shadow Man is close at hand
A      E                C#m
Take a turn and see his smile
         A               E
Made of nothing but loneliness
A       E          G#m
take a Boy and be a friend
               B
To the Shadow Man

         A                   G#m
You can call him Joe, you can call him Sam 
          C#m               B
You should call and see who answers
        E       G#m         B                  A  G#m F#m
For he promises to come running, guided by the truth
               A             E
But the Shadow Man is really you

B                      E
Look into his eyes and see your reflection
A                     F#m
Look to the stars and see his eyes
      B                         A
He'll show you tomorrow, he'll show you the sorrows
G#m             B
Of what you did today
   
        A                E
You can call him foe, you can call him friend
           C#m               G#m
You should call and see who answers
        E         G#m      B
For he knows your eyes are drawn
            F#m    B
To the road ahead
               A                         E
And the Shadow Man is waiting round the bend
(Fade out on A &E)
Oh, shadow man
Shadow man, shadow man
It's really you, it's really you, it's really you
He's the shadow man
