GOD KNOWS I'M GOOD from Space Oddity 


INTRO:  G  C C  G  F C
        G  C C  G  F C


      Am                  Am7           E7sus4      A7
I was walking through the counters of a national concern
      F                C              G       C C
And a cash machine was spitting by my shoulder
      Am           Am7            E7sus4           A7
And I saw the multitude of faces, honest, rich and clean
       F             C                 G     C C
As the merchandise exchanged and money roared
      C              G           Am               Am7
And a woman hot with worry slyly slipped a tin of stewing steak
D        C                G   C C
Into the paper bag at her side
        C                   G                Am             Am7
And her face was white with fear in case her actions were observed
       D                  C                   G    C C
So she closed her eyes to keep her conscience blind


CHORUS 1:
       Am            Am/G
Crying God knows I'm good
Am/F#         Am/F  F             E
God knows I'm good, God knows I'm good
Am               C           E
God may look the other way today
Am            Am/G  Am/F#         Am/F  F             E
God knows I'm good, God knows I'm good, God knows I'm good
Am               C           E
God may look the other way today


INTRO


         Am               Am7            E7sus4         A7
Then she moved toward the exit clutching tightly at her paper bag
F            C                 G       C C
Perspiration trickled down her forehead
        Am               Am7             E7sus4           A7
And her heart it leapt inside her as the hand laid on her shoulder
        F          C             G    C C
She was led away bewildered and amazed
            C                 G                  Am               Am7
Through her deafened ears the cash machines were shrieking on the counter
       D                C              G   C C
As her escort asked her softly for her name
      C               G                Am               Am7
And a crowd of honest people rushed to help a tired old lady
        D              C               G    C C
Who had fainted to the whirling wooden floor


CHORUS 2:
       Am            Am/G
Crying God knows I'm good
Am/F#         Am/F  F             E
God knows I'm good, God knows I'm good
Am              C              E
Surely God wont look the other way
Am            Am/G  Am/F#         Am/F  F             E
God knows I'm good, God knows I'm good, God knows I'm good
Am              C              E
Surely God wont look the other way
