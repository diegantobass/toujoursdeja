INTRO & VERSE: A B D
          A
You've arrived in the land
        B                    D
of a thousand different names
         A                  B                            D
And the fabulous sons have crashed their planes in flames
      A                         B                       D         
Now tomorrow's back claiming redemption is on your heels
        A                        B
And a toothless past is asking you
            D#m
how it feels

PRE-CHORUS:
    F
And me my little red Corvette
           Dm
has driven by
                                 Am
My fair weather heart has fallen in

My rainy day girl
            C
is feeling down
              A#
And she tells me
          F                 Am
that the world is spinning round
           A#               F
I say the dream was all for you
          Dm
You're nobody else

CHORUS:
F
Tonight the Zeroes were singing for you

Yeah Yeah
Yeah

VERSE:
Hi, can I walk you home
again today
Gotta get forgive and forget hey-hey
Something good is happening I don't know what it is
Don't you know we're back on trial again today

PRE-CHORUS:
And it's breaking wine for you
Hell it's only 'cause you're true
Someone outtimed my heart
Stopping and preaching
and letting love in
You are my moon, you are my sun
Heaven knows what you are

F                                  G
Tonight the Zeroes are singing for you

Yes they were
F
Tonight the Zeroes were singing for you
F
Tonight the Zeroes were singing for you

F#m             C#   
Doesn't matter what you try to do

C#('till fade)
