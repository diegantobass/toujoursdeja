FRIDAY ON MY MIND from Pin Ups 


INTRO:  E


Em                       A   D
Monday morning feels so bad
Em                  A   D
Everybody seems to nag me
G                     B
Coming Tuesday I feel better
E                     A
Even my old man looks good
A
Wednesday just don't go
Dm
Thursday goes too slow
Dm                     C   E  A F# B E
I've got Friday on my mind


CHORUS 1:
A                                   C#m
(See my baby) Gonna have fun in the city (feel like fucking you)
A                                           C#m
(Do my baby screw) Be with my girl she's so pretty (all I want to do)
                D
(I'll go crazy) She looks fine tonight
                 F#                     Bm
(zoom zoom zoom) She is out of sight to me (so divine)
   D
(Tonight)  I spend my bread
   B
(Tonight)  I lose my head
   D                         A    E
(Tonight)  I've got to get tonight
Am            D            G    E
Monday I have Friday on my mind


Em                         A        D   Em
Do the five day drag once more (Monday blue)
                           A    D
There is nothing else that bugs me
G                         B
More than working for the rich men (poor man, beggar man,  thief)
E                              A
Hey I'll change that scene one day
A
Today I might be mad
Dm
Tomorrow I'll be glad
Dm                             C   E  A F#  B E
'Cause I'll have Friday on my mind
