        G-  Bb/D  F


G-                Bb/F     F
Something kind of hit me today, I looked at you and 
G-/D            D             Eb  Bb/D
Wondered if you saw things my way
F              Gb dim     G- 
People will hold us to blame
   Bb/F       Eb        E 1/2dim   F
It hit me today,     it hit me today
      G-           Bb/F         F
We're taking it hard all the time
                     G-/D       D          Eb               Bb/D
Why don't we pass it by, just reply you've changed your mind
      F                 Gb dim           G-
We're fighting with the eyes of the blind
Bb/F         Eb     E 1/2dim     F           F/Eb  Bb/D  Bb
Taking it hard,     taking it hard, yet now


   F-/Ab            Gb     F                     C-
We feel that we are paper, choking on you nightly
     Bb-             F-/Ab         Gb                F
They tell me son, we want you, be elusive, but don't walk far
          C-               Bb-     F-/Ab                 Gb
For we're breaking in the new boys, deceive your next of kin
           F                 C-        Bb-          F-/Ab
For you're dancing where the dogs decay, defecating ecstasy
               Gb          F
You're just an ally of the leecher
  C-            Bb-                F-/Ab            Gb
Locator for the virgin King, but I love you in your fuck me pumps
         F                 C-
And your nimble dress that trails
    Bb-                F-/Ab             Gb               F
Oh, dress yourself, my urchin one, for I hear them on the rails
           C-            Bb-           F-/Ab
Because of all we've seen, because of all we've said
Gb         D  C/E  D  C/E
We are the dead


G-                Bb/F         F
One thing kind of touched me today
                    G-/D            D            Eb  Bb/D
I looked at you and counted all the times we had laid
F               Gb dim           G-
Pressing our love through the night
Bb/F            Eb       E 1/2dim         F
Knowing it's right,      knowing it's right
G-             Bb/F            F
Now I'm hoping some one will care
              G-/D        D            Eb    Bb/D
Living on the breath of a hope to be shared
F               Gb dim        G-
Trusting on the sons of our love
     Bb/F           Eb  E 1/2dim          F      F/Eb  Bb/D  Bb
That someone will care, someone will care, but now


        F-/Ab           Gb         F                           C-
We're today's scrambled creatures, locked in tomorrow's double feature
Bb-             F-/Ab       Gb               F
Heaven's on the pillow, its silence competes with hell
       C-               Bb-            F-/Ab            Gb
It's a twenty four hour service, guaranteed to make you tell
        F                   C-
And the streets are full of press men
        Bb-              F-/Ab
Bent on getting hung and buried
        Gb           F         C-               Bb-
And the legendary curtains are drawn round Baby Bankrupt
    F-/Ab                  Gb
Who sucks you while you're sleeping
         F            C-
It's the theater of financiers
          Bb-                F-/Ab
Count them,  round a table
Gb                   F
White and dressed to kill
     C-                Bb-
Oh caress yourself, my juicy
       F-/Ab              Gb
For my hands have all but withered
   F                 C-                Bb-              F-/Ab
Oh dress yourself my urchin one, for I hear them on the stairs
             Gb           F
Because of all we've seen
C-               Bb-
   Because of all we've said
D          C/E   D
We are the dead
C/E          D   C/E  D
We are the dead
C/E          D   C/E  D  C/E
We are the dead
