SHE'LL DRIVE THE BIG CAR from Reality


INTRO: F


C
She waited by the moon
        Cmaj7
She was sick with fear and cold
    C
She felt too old for all of this
   Cmaj7
Of course he'll never show
    Bb
She lugged her suitcase to the bus
Bbmaj7
Melted home, through the snow
               F          F+11
North-bound on river-side

C
She slipped beneath the sheets
       Cmaj7
Her husband's quiet devoted wife
    C
But strange, and sad, and nervous
       Cmaj7
By the dawn's early light
    Bb
And love lies like a dead clown
     Bbmaj7
On a shabby yellow lawn
      F         F+11
Up on Riverside


A
She'll drive the big car he'll sit behind
D
She'll keep her mind on Jessica South along the Hudson
A
She'll turn the radio high find a station playing sad, sad, soul
D
Just a little bit louder now (Just a little bit louder now)
South along the Hudson (I bring you there)
A
Just a little bit faster now (Just a little bit faster now)
Just a little bit louder now (Just a little bit louder now)
D
Just a little bit angry now (Just a little bit angry now)
South along the Hudson (I'll bring you there)
A
She'll drive the big car tuck herself to sleep (I'll bring you there)
F
Just a little bit louder now (Just a little bit louder now)
Just a little bit angry now (Just a little bit)


HARMONICA: F


C
Way back when millenium
      Cmaj7
Meant racing to the light
   C
He promised her the dream life
            Cmaj7
He took her back to street life


Bb
Away from the wild and water
         Bbmaj7
With his cormorants and leaves
      F         F+11
Up on Riverside


    A
Uh, she'll drive the big car and he'll sit behind
D
Bursting her bubbles of love and grand South along the Hudson
A
She'll turn the radio way up high find a station playing sad, sad soul
D
Just a little bit louder now (Just a little bit louder now) 
South along the Hudson (I'll bring you there)
A
Just a little bit faster now (Just a little bit faster now)
Just a little bit louder now (Just a little bit louder now)
D
Just a little bit angry now (Just a little bit angry now)
South along the Hudson (I'll bring you there)
A
Just a little bit faster now (Just a little bit faster now)
Just a little bit louder now (Just a little bit louder now)
D
Just a little bit angry now (Just a little bit angry now)
South along the Hudson (I'll bring you there)
A
She'll drive the big car he'll sit behind (I'm waiting now)
D
She'll keep her mind on Jessica just a little bit faster now (I'll bring 

you back)
A
Just a little bit faster now
