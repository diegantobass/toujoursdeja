BOMBERS 


CHORUS 1:
C   G                Bb F
All clear wailed the si-rens
C  G            Bb   F
Sunshine on the wasteland
C   G                  Bb    F
Old man sitting in the white sand
E                    A            F                 E   E7
Think we're in for a big surprise right between the eyes


C              G             Bb                    F
Seemed a good idea to drop a bomb on the wasteland here
Dm           F                        Eb         F
Only one man could be seen and he was old and so serene
C                  G                 Bb                  F
Captain sat in his deckchair and the red light flashed beware
Dm               F               Eb                      F
Pilot felt quite big time as the bomb sailed through the air
          C                      Dm
Well they danced & sang when the bang went bang
        Em                         F              Eb
but the lights bulked out when the smoke began to clear
                  G    G/F  G/E  G/D
It was positively queer 


CHORUS 2


C              G        Bb                  F
'Die' said the General, 'Cobblers' said the man
       Dm              F             Eb          F
So the Pentagon sent a cable and the Queen a telegram
C                G
A-bombs, H-bombs even very small ones
Bb                F
Ripped apart that sand
         Dm                F               Eb             F
Till the stench was just revolting and the sky a creamish tan
        C                            Dm
But the soldier said "Sir, there's a crack in the world"
        Em                          F                 Eb
And the blippers went spark and the bits went far and wide
                 G     G/F  G/E  G/D
how the universe sighed



CHORUS 3:
C   G                Bb F
All clear wailed the si-rens
C  G            Bb   F
Sunshine on the wasteland
C   G                  Bb    F
Old man sitting in the white sand
E                   A            F                 E   
Think were in for a big surprise right between the eyes


CHORUS 4:
C   G                Bb F
All clear wailed the si-rens
C  G            Bb   F
Sunshine on the wasteland
C   G                  Bb    F
Old man sitting in the white sand
E                   A            F                 E   E7
Think were in for a big surprise right between the eyes


Dm                 G                    C               F
When the smoke had blown away there was nothing left to view
         Eb                            D            F              C
Except a man dear lord who looked like you floating high up in the sky!
