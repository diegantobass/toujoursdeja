Don't let me hear you say life's taking you nowhere,  angel
F#       E          F#            E              
Come get up my baby. Look at that sky, life's begun

Nights are warm and the days are young

There's my baby, lost that's all

Last night they loved you, opening doors and pulling some strings, angel
F#          E
Come get up my baby

In walked luck and you looked in time

Some of these days, and it won't be long
      F#                        E
Gonna drive back down where you once belonged
       F#                  E
In the back of a dream car twenty foot long
      F#                  E
Don't cry my sweet, don't break my heart
F#                       E
Doing all right, but you gotta get smart
F#                    E
Wish upon, wish upon, day upon day,

I believe oh lord I believe all the way

Come get up my baby

Run for the shadows,
