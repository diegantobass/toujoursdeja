A                  B      A                          E
The air is getting hotter, there's a rumblin' in the sky
A                                B
I've been wading through the high muddy water
         A                      E
With the heat risin' through my eyes
C#m                   A
Every day your memory grows dimmer
F#                              E
It dosn't hurt me like it did before
A                             B
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere
A                                   E
Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door

BREAK: A  B  A  E  A  B  A  E


A             B          A               E
People on the platforms, waitin' for the trains
A                         B
I can hear their hearts a-beatin'
     A                            E
Like pendulums swinging on a chain
C#m                                 A
When you think that you've lost everything
         F#                        E
You find out you can lose a little more
A                            B
I'm just goin' down tha-that road feeling bad
A                           E
Tryin' hard to get to heaven before they close the door
A  B                       A                      E
Ooh Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door
A  B                       A                      E
Ooh Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door
G   A    C   D   E
Ooh Ooh, Ooh Ooh Ooh


A  B                       A                      E
Ooh Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door
A  B                       A                      E
Ooh Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door

A                  B      A                        E
I'm goin' down the river, going down to New Orleans
A                               B
They tell me everything's gonna be all right
      A                              E
But I don't know what all right even means
C#m                   A
I close my eyes and I wonder boys
F#                               E
If everything is as hollow as it seems
A                          B
I've been to sugar town, I shook the sugar down
A                                             E
Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door
A  B                       A                      E
Ooh Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door
A  B                       A                      E
Ooh Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door
A  B                       A                      E
Ooh Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door (I've been all around the world, boys)
A  B                       A                    E
Ooh Tryin' to get to heaven before they close...the door
