Intro: E D E D, E D E D

D                                  E
Tragic youth was looking young and sexy
D                                           E
The tragic youth was wearing tattered black jeans
D                                  E
Bearing arms and flaunting all her mischief
D                                   E
Then tragic youth was going down on me 
E     D  
And I swear
        E
Hoo, hoo
       D    E
Yes I swear

C                           F#
I built a wall of sound to separate us
C                                F#
I hid among the junk of wretched highs
C                              F#
I sped from Planet X to Planet Alpha
C               D
Struggling for reality
E              D
Ha, ha, ha, ha,
E              D
Ha, ha, ha, ha

D                                    E
Hey, now my sight is failing in this twilight
D                               E
Duh duh duh duh duh-duh duh-duh-duh
D                                E
Now my death is more than just a sad song
D                              E
Da duh duh duh duh-duh duh-duh-duh
E          D
And I swear
        E
Hoo, hoo
           D
Yes I swear
        E
Hoo, hoo

C                               F#
I still don't remember how this happened
C                                          F#
I still don't get the 'wherefores' and the 'whys'
C                                  F#
I look for sense but I get next to nothing
          C            D
Hey, boy, welcome to reality
E
Ha, ha, ha, ha
D
Woo, hoo

E                    C#m
I've been right, and I've been wrong
Bm                   D   
Now I'm back where I started from
E
Never looked over reality's shoulder
