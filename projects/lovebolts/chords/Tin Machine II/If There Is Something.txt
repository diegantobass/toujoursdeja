If There Is Something
=====================

B
If there is something
E
That I might find
B
Look around corners
E                            
Try to find peace of mind, I say
F#
"Where would you go
A
If you were me?
C                                       E
Trying to keep a straight course is not easy"
(Next verse same as above)

Somebody special
Looking at me
Same kind of reaction
Wanted to cry with me
If there are many
Too easy to say
When it's love 
It's just a game-ame-ame-ame

B                     A
I would do anything for you
I would come all day
E                          F#
I would swim all the oceans blue
B                       A
I would walk a thousand miles
Reveal my secrets
E                         F#
More than enough for me to share
B                            A
I will put roses around your door
Sit in the garden
E                      F#
Growing potatoes by the score

B                             A
Shake your head girl, with your ponytail
         E                        F#
Takes me right back [when you were young]
 B                               A
Throw your precious gifts into the air
          E                        F#
Watch them fall down [when you were young]
Etc etc etc...........

Your love - could feel you put them on the ground
It used to fall apart [when you were young]

Your love - could feel you put them on the ground
The hills were higher [when you were young]

Your love - could feel you put them on the ground
The trees were taller then [when you were young]

Your love - could feel you put them on the ground
The grass was greener [when you were young]

Your love - could feel you put them on the ground
It use to fall apart [when you were young]
