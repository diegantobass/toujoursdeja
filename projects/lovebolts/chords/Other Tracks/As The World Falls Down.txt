(Verse 1)
A
There's such a sad love
				     F#m
Deep in your eyes, a kind of pale jewel
				    D
Open and closed within your eyes
		Dm		  A
I'll place the sky within your eyes

(Verse 2)

There's such a fooled heart
				     F#m
Beating so fast in search of new dreams

A love that will last within your heart
		Dm		   A
I'll place the moon within your heart


          (Chorus)
Bm
As the pain sweeps through
           Dm
Makes no sense for you
         A
Every thrill he's caused
       F#m                 A
Wasn't too much fun at all
A                             F#m
But I'll be there for you-oo-oo

I'll paint you mornings of gold

I'll spin you Valentine evenings
		 F#m
Though we're strangers till now
   	                             D
We're choosing the path between the stars

I'll lay my love between the stars

          (Chorus)
