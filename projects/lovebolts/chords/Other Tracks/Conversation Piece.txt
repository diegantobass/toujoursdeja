CONVERSATION PIECE 


INTRO:  G  D  G


            D               Am7
I took this walk to ease my mind
Am
To find out what's gnawing at me
C                            G
Wouldn't think, to look at me
          Am7 
that I've spent a lot of time in education
C                       G
It all seems so long ago
      Am7
I'm a thinker, not a talker
C
I've no-one to talk to, anyway


CHORUS 1:
  G             F
I can't see the road
        C          G
for the rain in my eyes
F    C         G
Ahhh-huh, huh, huh


        D                Am
I live above the grocers store 
Am7
Owned by an Austrian
C                            G
He often calls me down to eat
       Am7
And he jokes about his broken English
C                         G
tries to be a friend to me
        Am
But for all my years of reading conversation
C
I stand without a word to say


CHORUS 2:
  G             F
I can't see the bridge
        C          G
for the rain in my eyes
F    C         G
Ahhh-huh, huh, huh


        A                E
And the world is full of life
Bm
Full of folk who don't know me
D                                      A
And they walk in twos or threes or more
          Bm
While the lamp that shines above the grocer's store
D                             A
Investigates my face so rudely
       Bm
And my essays lying scattered on the floor
D
Fulfill their needs just by being there
       A               G
And my hands shake, my head hurts
   D              A
My voice sticks inside my throat
                  G
I'm invisible and dumb
    D             A
And no-one will recall me


CHORUS 3:
      A             G
And I can't see the water
        D           F  G   A
for the tears in my ey-y-yes
