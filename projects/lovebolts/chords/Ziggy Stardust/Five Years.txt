FIVE YEARS from Ziggy Stardust


G                                Em
Pushing through the market square, so many mothers sighing
A                               C 
News had just come over, we had five years left to cry in
G                          Em
News guy wept and told us, earth was really dying
A                                      C
Cried so much his face was wet, then I knew he was not lying
        G
I heard telephones, opera house, favourite melodies
      Em	
I saw boys, toys, electric irons and TV's
   A
My brain hurt like a warehouse, it had no room to spare
         C	
I had to cram so many things to store everything in there
                Am           C                        Am
And all the fat-skinny people, and all the tall-short people
C                  G     C                      D
And all the nobody people, and all the somebody people
                                 Am     C
I never thought I'd need so many people

G                               Em
A girl my age went off her head, hit some tiny children
A                                     C
If the black hadn't pulled her off, I think she would have killed them
G                                        Em
A soldier with the broken arm, fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
A                                                    C
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest, and the queer threw up at the sight of that
G                                          Em			
I think I saw you in an ice-cream parlour, drinking milk shakes cold and long
A                                      C
Smiling and waving and looking so fine, don't think you knew you were in this song.
           G		
And it was cold and it rained so I felt like an actor
      Em
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there
     A
Your face, your race, the way that you talk
  C
I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk.

       G
We got five years, stuck on my eyes
Em
Five years, what a surprise
       A
We got five years, my brain hurts a lot
C
Five years, that's all we got 
       G
We got five years, what a suprise
Em
Five years, stuck on my eyes
       A
We got five years, my brain hurts a lot
C
Five years, that's all we got 
       G
We got five years, stuck on my eyes
Em
Five years, what a surprise
       A
We got five years, my brain hurts a lot
C
Five years, that's all we got 
       G
We got five years, what a suprise
Em
Five years, stuck on my eyes
       A
We got five years, my brain hurts a lot
C
Five years, that's all we got 
G          Em         A          C          G
Five years five years five years five years
