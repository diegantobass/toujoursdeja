Up ev-'ry eve-nin' 'bout half eight or nine I give my

com-plete at-ten-tion to a ver-y good friend of mine.

He's quad-ra-phonic; he's a, he's got more channels.
F                       Fm            C
So hol-o-gram-ic, oh my TVC one five. I brought my ba-by

home; she, she sat a-round for-lorn. She saw my TVC one five;

-ba-by's gone, yeah. She crawled right in, oh my. She crawled
             F                       Fm
right in my, so hol-o-gram-ic, oh my TVC one five. 
E7                     G7
Oh so de-mon-ic, oh my TVC one five.
C
May-be if I pray ev-ry, each night I sit there plead-in'
,
"Send back my dream-test ba-by. She's my main fea-ture."

My TVC one five, he, he just stares back un-blink-ing.
F                      Fm            C
So hol-o-gramic, oh my TVC one five. One of these nights

I may just jump down that rain-bow way; be with my ba-by.

Then we'll spend some time to-geth-er. So hol-o-gram-ic,
                    F
oh my TVC one five. My ba-by's in there some-place.
Fm                       E7                      G
Love rat-ing in the sky. So hol-o-gram-ic, oh my TVC one five.

Tran-si-tion. Trans-mis-sion.
