The London boys  - David Bowie

F                Dm
Bow bell strikes another night
Eb                      Cm
Your eyes are heavy and your limbs all ache
F                          Dm
You've bought some coffee, butter and bread
Eb                           Cm
You can't make a thing cause the meter's dead
F                  Ab
You moved away
F                                       Ab
Hold your folks you're gonna stay away


Eb                   Ab
Bright lights, Soho, Wardour street
F                              Eb
You hope you make friends with the guys that you meet

Oh, the first time that you tried a pill
Eb                         Cm
You feel a little queasy, decidedly ill
F                             Dm
You're gonna be sick, but you mustn't lose faith
Eb                              Cm
To let yourself down would be a big disgrace
F                        Ab   
With the London boys  
F                        Ab 
With the London boys


Eb                             Ab
You're only seventeen, but you think you've grown
F                                       Eb
In the month you've been away from your parents' home
Bbm                    Ab
You take the pills too much
Db                               Ab 
You don't give a damn about that jobs you've got

A London boy, a London boy
F                                  D      
You're crying out loud that you're a London boy
A                      F#m
You think you've had a lot of fun

But you ain't got nothing, you're on the run

Now you wish you'd never left your home
F#                             A         
You've got what you wanted but you're on your own
Db       F#          B
With the London boys
Ab                 Db     F#      B
