The Pretty Things Are Going To Hell- David Bowie

(Written by David Bowie and Reeves Gabrel)



INTRO: C

F
What to do
What to say
What to do on a sunny day
Who to phone
Who to fight
Who to dance with on a Sunday night
F
Reaching the very edge, you know
Reaching the very edge
Going to the other side this time
Reaching the very edge

CHORUS:
  C                              Ab
  You're still breathing but you don't know why
  C                G
  Life's a bit and sometimes you die
  C                              Ab
  You're still breathing but you just can't tell
  C                                 G                          C
  Don't hold your breath 'cause the pretty things are going to hell

C
I am a drug, I am a dragon
F
I am the best jazz you've ever seen
I am a dragon,I am the sky
C
I am the blood in the corner of your eye
I found the secrets,I found gold
F
I find you out before you grow old
I found you out before you grow old

INTERLUDE:  C

F
What is eternal
What is dammed
What is clay and what is sand
Who to dis
Who to truss
Who to listen to
Who to suss

F
I'm reaching the very edge, you know
I'm reaching the very edge
I'm going to the other side this time
I'm reaching the very edge

CHORUS 

C
I am a dragon
I am a drug
F
I am the best jazz you've ever heard
I am a dragon
I am the sky
C
I am the blood at the corner of your eye
I find the secrets
I find gold
F
I find you out before you grow old
I find you out before you grow old

The guitar lick in the intro, the interlude
and the ending is:

B------------------------------------
G--10bu12rb10--10~~----10----9~~-----
D-------------------12----12---------
A------------------------------------
the lick is played with many artificial 
harmonics in different places in the lick

 10bu12rb10 = bend up from 10 to 12 and then release 
              the bend back to 10 again.
         ~~ = vibrato
