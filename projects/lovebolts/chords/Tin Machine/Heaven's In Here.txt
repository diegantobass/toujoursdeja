E                    D          C      D   E
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh oh oh oooooooooo oooooooooooooh
E                         D
Baby I dream between the blade and the tongue
       G                      D
Of the rose on your cheek the wounded and dumb
 E                  D
We stumble and fall we stumble and fall
G                        D
Skin on skin but there's heaven , Heaven's

CHORUS
        E
   in here
  D            E
  Heaven's in here
              D           E
  Among the twilight and stars
          D        E
  Like a rocket to mars
  G           E
  Heaven's in here
E                           D
The first and the last are telling it all
G                     D
Telling you loud but selling it small
E                         D
I'm taking a swing at this shadow of mine
G                     D
Crucifix hangs an' my heart's in my mouth
         E
But it's here

CHORUS
 D            E
  Heaven's in here
              D           E
  Among the twilight and stars
          D        E
  Like a rocket to mars
  G           E
  Heaven's in here

Solo
 D            E
Heaven in one sigh
D             E
MMM MMMMM MMM MMM MMM

  E     D
  C      D

E                        D
Heaven lies between your marbled thighs
   C               D
The rustle of your falling gown
   E                 D
We stumble and fall like tragedy falls
   G                        D
We stumble and twirl there's heaven in here
   E                   D
We stumble and fall uncertain we fall
  G                        D
Flesh on flesh but there's heaven in...
            E
Heaven's in here

CHORUS

You'll dance to my tongue we'll dance on the sun
We're the twilight and stars
There's heaven in here
