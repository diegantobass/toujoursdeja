I count the corpses on my left I find I'm not so tidy
                            A
So I better get away better make it today
         C                       G
I've cut twenty three down since friday 
    D E Esus4    A      Asus4  A
But I   can't control it 
   D                E        Esus4  A
My face is drawn my instinct still emotes it


D  C G  D  C G


  D                 G         D
I slash them cold I kill them dead 
  G                 C             A
I broke the gooks I cracked their heads
     D                  G           D
I'll bomb them out from under their beds 
    C        F       C
But now I've got the running gun blues

   G                   A
It seems the peacefuls stopped the war 
     C                     G
Left Generals squashed and stifled
                   A   
But I'll slip out again tonight 
            C                     G
'Cause they haven't taken back my rifle
    D E Esus4    A      Asus4  A
For I   promote oblivion 
    D  E Esus4        A
And I'll plug a few civilians

     D                    G         D
I'll slash them cold I'll kill them dead 
     G                    C           A
I'll break the gooks I'll crack their heads
     D                       G       D
I'll slice them till they're running red 
    C        F       C                D  C G  D  C G
But now I've got the running gun blues
