It's love back to front and no sides - like I say
                     C                 A
These pieces are broken - like I say
                        C
These pieces are broken

Hope I'm wrong but I know

Sad  So I'll dance my life away

A million dreams, a million scars

Em C

He punishes hard - was loving her such a crime
She took back everything she said
Left him nearly out of his mind
They're people I know - people I love
They seem so unhappy - dead or alive

It's love back to front and no sides - like I say
These pieces are broken - like I say
These pieces are broken
Hope I'm wrong but I know

CHORUS

A million dreams
A million scars
A million (repeat ad inf.)
