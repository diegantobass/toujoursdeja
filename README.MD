# Toujours-déjà

Toujours-déjà is a personal space and serves as a display shelf for ongoing and long dead projects by Diégo Antolinos-Basso.

It's also how I learned what 'this' was in javascript and why CORS are prohibited.

I do not commit the many pictures that are on display on [the website](http://www.toujoursdeja.fr) to this repo.
