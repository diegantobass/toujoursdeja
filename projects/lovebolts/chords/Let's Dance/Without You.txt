Without You
Lyrics and music by David Bowie

Intro
Bb  Eb  Bb  Eb  Ab Eb Bb

G                      Ab
Just when I'm ready to throw in my hand
Bb                                    Bb
Just when the best things in life are gone
Ab
I look into your eyes
Bb         Eb
There's no smoke without fire
Bb                   Eb
You're exactly who I want to be with
Bb  Eb
Without you
Bb              Eb  Ab  Bb
What would I do


Bb  Eb  Bb  Eb  Ab Eb Bb 


G                       Ab   
And when I'm willing to call it a day
Bb                             Bb
Just when I won't take another chance
Ab
I hold your hand
Bb         Eb
There's no smoke without fire
Bb      Eb
Woman I love you
Bb  Eb
Without you
Bb              Eb  Ab  Bb
What would I do

Bb  Eb  Bb  Eb  Ab Eb Bb
Eb  Bb  Ab
