INTRO:  D  Bb
        D  D/C  G/B  G/Bb


D           D/C  G/B     G/Bb        D
I bless you madly, sadly as I tie my shoes
           D/C  G/B       G/Bb              D     D/C
I love you badly, just in time, at times, I guess
G/B        G/Bb          D   D/C
Because of you I need to rest
G/B          G/Bb              D
Because it's you that sets the test


Eb                   Bbm
So much has gone and little is new
           A
And as the sparrow sings
     F#         Bbm
Dawn chorus for someone else to hear
            A          F#         Bbm
The thinker sits alone growing older and so bitter 


F                             Bbm
I gave them life, I gave them all
     C               Fm
They drained my very soul dry
F                                Bbm
I crushed my heart to ease their pains
   C                Fm         Ab
No thought for me remains there
Bbm              Db            C  C/B
Nothing can they spare what of me
Am                                   F
Who praised their efforts to be free
G                                   C  C/B
Words of strength and care and sympathy
Am                                              F
I opened doors that would have blocked their way
  G                                          C  C/B
I braved their cause to guide, for little pay
Am                                    F
I ravaged at my finance just for those
            G                                      C  C/B
Those whose claims were steeped in peace, tranquility
          Am                                  F
Those who said a new world, new ways ever free
                               G                       C  C/B
Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me


BREAK:  Am  F  G


D           D/C  G/B     G/Bb        D
I bless you madly, sadly as I tie my shoes
           D/C  G/B       G/Bb              D     D/C
I love you badly, just in time, at times, I guess
G/B        G/Bb          D   D/C
Because of you I need to rest, oh yeah
G/B          G/Bb              D
Because it's you that sets the test


Eb                   Bbm
So much has gone and little is new
           A              F#          Bbm
And as the sunrise stream flickers on me
                          A
My friends talk of glory, untold dream
      F#             Bbm
Where all is God and God is just a word

F                          Bbm
We had a friend, a talking man
    C             Fm
Who spoke of many powers that he had
F                           Bbm
Not of the best of men, but ours
        C              Fm            Ab
We used him we let him use his powers
   Bbm                   Db          C     C/B
We let him fill our needs now we are strong
        Am                       F
And the road is coming to its end
        G                            C    C/B
Now the damned have no time to make amends
   Am                                      F
No purse of token fortune stands in our way
    G                                     C  C/B
The silent guns of love will blast the sky
Am                                          F
We broke the ruptured structure built of age
    G                                  C    C/B
Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage 
      Am                                F
Where money stood we planted seeds of rebirth
    G                                    C   C/B
And stabbed the backs of Fathers Sons of dirt 
Am                                            F
Infiltrated business cesspools hating through our sleeves 
             G                                           C
Yeah, and we slit the Catholic throat stoned the poor on slogans such as 
                             C/B          Am
Wish you could hear, love is all we need, kick out the jams 
                      F
Kick out your Mother, cut up your friend
                               G
Screw up your Brother or he'll get you in the end
       C                                  C/B  Am
And we know the flag of love is from above
           F
And we can force you to be free     
           G
And we can force you to believe
C                       Am
And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain
                                    F
For I once read a book in which the lovers were slain
                                        G
For they knew not the words of the free states
        C                             C/B
It said I believe in the power of good     
    Am
I believe in the state of love
       F
I will fight for the right to be right
       G                                                  C
I will kill for the good of the fight for the right to be right
      C/B             Am
And I open my eyes to look around
F                                         Gsus4 G
And I see a child laid slain on the ground
C                 Am                             
As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows
F                   G
Ploughing down man, woman, listening to its command
        C              C/B   Am              F  Fsus4  F
But not hearing anymore, not hearing anymore
         G                                         C
Just the shrieks from the old rich and I Want to Believe
                          G                   C
In the madness that calls now and I want to Believe
                       G                               Bb
That a light's shining through somehow and I Want to Believe
                  F
And You Want to Believe
                 C
And We Want to Believe 
               G
And We Want to Live
               Ab              Bb
Oh, We Want to Live We Want to Live 
           C               G               Ab
We Want to Live We Want to Live We Want to Live
           Bb             C
We Want to Live I Want to Live 
          G              Ab             Bb
I Want to Live I Want to Live I Want to Live
          C              G
I Want to Live I Want to Live
Ab    Bb    C   G  Ab  Bb  C  G
Live, live, live
