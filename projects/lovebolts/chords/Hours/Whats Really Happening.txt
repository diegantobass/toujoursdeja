WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING? from Hours 


INTRO:  Bb  Ab  G  Gb  F  G


G              Bb
Grown inside a plastic box 
F                  G
Micro thoughts and safety locks 
G                Bb
Hearts become outdated clocks 
F               G
Ticking in your mind 
G                Bb
Now it's time to close our eyes 
F                G
Now it's time to say goodbye 
G                Bb
Now it's time to face the lie 
F               G
That we'd never cry 


CHORUS 1:
D
What's really happening
C
What tore us apart
B                      A
What's really happening
D
What's really happening
C
What tore us apart
B                      A  B  G
What's really happening


G                  Bb
All the clouds are made of glass 
F                  G
And they're slowly sinking 
G                Bb
Falling like the shattered past 
F                G
Were we built to last

That we'd never cry
