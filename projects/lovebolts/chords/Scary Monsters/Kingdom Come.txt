KINGDOM COME

E
Well I walked in the pouring rain
And I heard a voice that cries
"It's all in vain"
C#m
The voice of doom
B
was shining in my room
Abm         F#
I just need one day
Abm         F#
somewhere far away
Abm                  F#
Lord I just need one day


B                                  E    
Well I'll be breaking these rocks
B                                  E 
And cutting this hay
B                                  E 
Yes I'll be breaking these rocks
B                                  E 
What's my price to pay?



Well the river's so muddy,
but it may come clear
And I know too well what's keeping me here
I'm just the slave of a burning ray
Oh give me the night,
I can't take another sight
Please, please give me the night

CHORUS....  

Abm                                       Ebm
Sun keeps beating down on me, wall's a mile high
Dbm                                        F#
Up in the tower they're watching me hoping I'm gonna die


B                                  E    
I won't be breaking no rocks
B                                  E    
I said "I won't be breaking no rocks"

(I won't be breaking no rocks)
(I won't be breaking no rocks)
(I won't be breaking no rocks)
When the kingdom comes
