THE DREAMERS from Hours 


INTRO:  F#  F#  Bb  Bb  G#  G#  Bb


Bb
Black eyed ravens
F#
They spiral down
Bb
And they tilt his head back
F#
To the flame filled sunset
Bb
Raise their guns high
F#
As the darken falls
Bb
These are the days boys
G#
Shallow man
F#
Shallow man and they
G#
Eats in the doorway
         F#
With his head inclined
         G#
And he's always in decline
       F#
No one heals anymore
      G#
So he shrinks as they ride
      F#
Under vermillion sky


      Bb   Gm
So it goes just a searcher
F#                Gm
A lonely soul the last of the dreamers


G#
Shallow man
F#
Shallow man
G#
Speaks to the shadows
F#
Moves his trembling hands
         G#
And he's always a little late
        F#
For the dawning of the day



      Bb   Gm
So it goes just a searcher
    F#          F
Lonely soul the last of the dreamers
Bb                Gm
So it goes just a searcher
    F#          F
Lonely soul the last of the dreamers
Bb                Gm
So it goes just a searcher
      F#          F                F#          Bb  G#       Bb
A Lonely soul the last of the dreamers...so it goes...so it goes
