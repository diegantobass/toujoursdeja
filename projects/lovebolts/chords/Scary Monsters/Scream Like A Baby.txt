SCREAM LIKE A BABY

Intro: Cm - G - Cm - G - Cm

                         G7
Well I wouldn't buy no merchandise
      Cm4             G7
And I wouldn't go to war
       Bb(9)           Eb9
And I mixed with other colours
         Bb(9)           Eb6/9
But the nurse doesn't care
                  G7
And I hide under blankets
   Cm4         G7
Or did I run away
    Bb(9)           Eb9
I really can't remember
     Bb(9)           Eb9
Last time I saw the light of day
C#             Fm/C
But I remember Sam
       Fdim/B        c -  C7 -  F/A  -  Fm/Ab  -  Bb6
'cause he was like me

CHORUS
Eb            Bb
Scream like a baby
Eb        Dm
Sam was a gun
    Am               E7
And I never knew his last name
     F             G     G/F     Em7
And we never had no fun

Well they came down hard on the faggots
And they came down hard on the street
They came down harder on Sam
And they all knew he was beat
He was thrown into the wagon
Blindfolded, chains,
and they stomped on us
And took away our clothes and things
And pumped us full of strange drugs
And oh I saw Sam falling
Spitting in their eyes
But now I lay me down to sleep
And now I close my eyes
Now I'm learning
to be a part of soc-society

CHORUS....

Dm6/D - C# - C - D  *
No athletic program,no discipline, no book
Dm6/D - C# - C - D  *
He just sat in the backseat swearing he'd seek revenge
Gm      F#5+     Bb/F      Edim
But he jumped into the furnace Singing old songs we loved

CHORUS
Eb            Bb
Scream like a baby
Eb        Dm
Sam was a gun
    Am               E7
And I never knew his last name
     F             G     G/F     A7
And we never had no fun

D           A
Scream like a baby
D       C#m
Sam was a gun
    Abm               Eb7
And I never knew his last name
     E             F#     F#/E     Ebm7
And we never had no fun
