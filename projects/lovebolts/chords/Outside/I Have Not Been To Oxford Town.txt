     This is your shadow on my wall,    this is my flesh and blood,
     this is what I could have been...

     This is my bunk with two sheets,    this is my food,though foul,
     this is what I could have been...

     and the wheels are turning and turning,as this 20th century dies,
     if I had not ripped the fabric,if time had not stood still,
     if I had not met Ramona,if I'd only paid my bill
