G     G6            A     A6
Me, I hope that I'm crazy
G          G6                 Fmaj7    F6
I feel you driving and you're only the wheel
G          G6          A       A6
Slow down, let someone love you
G               G6                  Fmaj7      F6
Ohh, I've never touched you since I started to feel
G          G6         A      A6
If there's nothing to hide me
G                 G6              Fma7      F6
Then you've never seen me hanging naked and wired
G        G6        A          A6  Fmaj7  F6   D
Somebody lied, but I say it's hip To be alive


CHORUS
C        Am       D

Me, I'm fresh on your pages
G      G6                Fmaj7      F6
Secret thinker sometimes listening aloud
G         G6            A   A6
Life lies dumb on its heroes
G         G6                Fmaj7        F6
Wear your wound with honor, make someone proud
G            G6         A        A6       Fmaj7     F6   D
Someone like you should not be allowed To start any fires
