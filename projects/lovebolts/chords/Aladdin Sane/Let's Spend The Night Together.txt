INTRO:  E


A                           C#m                   E
Well, don't you worry 'bout what's been on my mind
A                     C#m         E
I'm in no hurry I can take my time
D                                     A    E
I'm going red and my tongue's getting tired
D                                     C#m
Out of my head and my mouth's getting dry, I'm h-h-h-high


CHORUS 1:
E
Let's spend the night together now I need you more than ever
                               A  C#m  E
Let's spend the night together now


A                       C#m                  E
I feel so strong that I can't disguise, oh my
A                   C#m         E
Well, I just can't apologise, no
D                                 A   E
Don't hang me up but don't let me down
D                                  C#m
We could have fun just by fooling around, and around and around


CHORUS 2:
E
Let's spend the night together now I need you more than ever
                               D
Let's spend the night together now


A
Oh, you know I'm smiling baby
D
You need some guiding baby
A
I'm just deciding baby


CHORUS 3:
E
Let's spend the night together now I need you more than ever
                               A  C#m  E
Let's spend the night together now


A                         C#m      E
This doesn't happen to me every day
A                   C#m        E
No excuses I've got anyway, heh
D                       A   E
I'll satisfy your every need
D                            C#m
And I'll know you'll satisfy me, oh my-my-my my-my


CHORUS 4:
E
Let's spend the night together now I need you more than ever
E
Let's spend the night together now I need you more than ever
E
Let's spend the night together now I need you more than ever
E
Let's spend the night together

They said we were too young
Our kind of love was no fun
But our love comes from above
Do it!
Let's make love
Hoo!


CHORUS 5:
E
Let's spend the night together now I need you more than ever
                               A
Let's spend the night together now!
