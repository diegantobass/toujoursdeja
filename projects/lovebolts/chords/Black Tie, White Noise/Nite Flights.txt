NITE FLIGHTS

Intro: G - Am/G - G9 - F/G 

G
There's no hold
The moving has come through
G(7)
The danger passing you
                                          Bm
Turns its face into the heat and runs the tunnels

      Em/(e - f# - g      -       a)*
It's so cold, The dark dug up by dogs
      Em/(e -          f# -       g      -       a)*
The stiches torn and broke, The raw meat fist you choke
Bb
Has hit the bloodlite

C                             Bb
Glass traps open and close on nite flights
C                                      Gm
Broken necks feather weights press the walls
C                               Bb
Be my love, we will be gods on nite flights
C                                      Gm
With only one promise, only one way to fall


Glass traps open and close on nite flights

Be my love, we will be gods on nite flights
With only one promise, only one way to call


On nite flights
Only one way to fall
