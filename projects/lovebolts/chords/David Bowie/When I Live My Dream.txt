F/C                       F/C                                  Gm/C
When I live my dream I'll take you with me, riding on a golden horse.

      F/C                        Gm/C            F/C
We'll live within my castle with people there to serve you,

F/C          Cm7           F        Gm7      C7	
happy at the sound of your voice.

F            Gm7          C         Bb   
May-be I'll slay a dragon for you, 

   F             Gm7             C      Bb
or banish wicked giants from the land,

    F        Ebadd9     Eb      F             Bb
but you will find--------- that nothing in my dream can hurt you,

Cm           Eb               F          Bb             Gm7   C   C7 
we will only love each other, as forever when I live my dream.

F/C etc
When I live my dream, I'll forgive the things you told me, 
and the empty man you left behind.
It's a broken heart that dreams, It's a broken heart you left me,
only love can live in my dreams.

Wish- and the thunder clouds will vanish,
wish- and the storm will fade away,
wish again---------and you will stand before me while the sky will
paint an overture and trees will play the rhythm of my dream.


When I live my dream, please be there to meet me,
let me be the one to understand.
When I live my dream, I'll forget the hurt you gave me, then we
can live in our new land.

Till the day my dream cascades around me,
I'm content to let you pass me by,           F           Bb
till that day-------------------------you'll run to many other men,


    Cm                 Eb            Asus4               C
but let them know it's just for now, tell them that I've got a dream

    D                    G
and tell them you're the starring role,

Ab              Db               Eb       Cm                      Ab         Fm  
tell them I'm a dreaming kind of guy--------And I'm gonna make my dream-----

Db               C       Bb               F 
Tell them I will live my dream-----------

F                  C        Bb            F 
Tell them they can laugh at me-----------

F                     C         Bb
But don't forget your date with me-----------
