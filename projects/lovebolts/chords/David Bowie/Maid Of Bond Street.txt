Maid of Bond Street - David Bowie


E                    F#m 
This girl is made of lipstick
G
Powder and paint
C                    Am 
Sees the pictures of herself
F                 G
Every magazine on every shelf


E                    F#m 
This girl is maid of Bond Street
G             C            Am
Hailing cabs, lunches with executives
F                  G
Gleaming teeth sip aperitifs


E              D
This girl is a lonely girl
E                               D
Takes the train from Paddington to Oxford Circus
E
Buys the Daily News
D              C                   Am     F              G 
But passengers don't smile at her, oh no, don't smile at her


E                    F#m
This girl is made of loneliness
G
A broken heart
C                Am
For the boy that she once knew
F                    G
Doesn't want to know her any more

E                  D
And this girl is a lonely girl
E                     D
Every thing she wants is hers
E                                             D
But she can't make it with the boy she really wants to be with
C             Am       F       G
All the time, to love, all the time


E                   F#m
This boy is made of envy
G
Jealousy
C                 Am
He doesn't have a limousine
F                    G
Really wants to be a star himself


E          G            A       D               G 
This girl, her world is made of flashlights and films
G             A             D            G
Her cares are scraps on the cutting room floor

G            C           F              G
And maids of Bond Street drive round in chauffered cars
G             C      F                G
Maids of Bond Street picture clothes, eyes of stars
G             C      F              G
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have worldly cares
(G             C)    F              G
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have love affairs
