Little Wonder

VERSE:
 
 E                   Dbm
 Stinky weather, fat shaky hands
 A                  C
 Dopey morning Doc, grumpy gnomes
 E                   Dbm
 Little wonder then, little wonder
 A                         C
You little wonder, little wonder you
 E                  Dbm
 Big screen dolls, tits and explosions
 A           C
 Sleepytime, bashful but nude
 E                   Dbm
 Little wonder then, little wonder
 A                         C
 You little wonder, little wonder you

      (same chords)
 Intergalactic, see me to be you
 It's all in the tablets, sneezy Bhutan
 Little wonder then, little wonder
 You little wonder, little wonder you

 Mars Happy nation, sit on my karma
 Dame meditation, take me away
 Little wonder then, little wonder
 You little wonder, little wonder you

           G            A
 Sending me so far away, so far away,
