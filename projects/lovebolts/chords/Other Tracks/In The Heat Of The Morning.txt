IN THE HEAT OF THE MORNING

INTRO:   C  G  A  
         C  G  Am
         C  G  A 

G                          Bm              C
My Memory keeps me turning round, turning around,
               A
Looking down the valley of years.
G                               Bm
Where cunning magpies steal your name,
         C
I’m watching your face 
                A
Appear on a cloud drifting by.
Abm            B
I’m so much in love
                        A
Like a little soldier catching butterflies,
Am                C
No man loved like I love you
             Dm                 Am
Wouldn’t you like to love me too


                   C
In the heat of the morning
D                        Am
In the shadow I’ll clip your wings
                    C
And tomorrow will find us
D                   Am
In the heat of the morning


BREAK:  C  G  A
        C  G  A

G                            Bm                C
I’ll take the flower from your hand, challenge the trees
                A
To take away my place with you.
G                            Bm
I’ll take the diamonds from the Sun
               C
Organise the breeze,
                   A
I’ll prove that it can be done
Abm                 B
Oh, I’m so much in love
                      A
Like the silent moonbeam speckled on the sea
Am                C
No man loved like I love you 
             Dm              Am
Wouldn’t you like to love me too


Am                 C
In the heat of the morning
D                        Am
In the shadow I’ll clip your wings
                    C
And tomorrow will find us 
D                   Am
In the heat of the morning


C  G  A…
