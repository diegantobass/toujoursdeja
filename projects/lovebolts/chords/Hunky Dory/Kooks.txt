CHORUS 2 + INTRO


   D                                  A
We bought a lot of things to keep you warm and dry
      D                           A
And a funny old crib on which the paint won't dry
D              G
I bought you a pair of shoes
  D                          G
A trumpet you can blow and a book of rules
   D                               A
On what to say to people when they pick on you 
Cause if you stay with us you're gonna be pretty kookie too


CHORUS 3 + INTRO


D                       A
And if you ever have to go to school 
D                           A
Remember how they messed up this old fool
D                          G
Don't pick fights with the bullies or the cads
          D                        G
Cause i'm not much cop at punching other peoples dads
D                   A
And if the homework brings you down
Then we'll throw it on the fire and take the car down town
