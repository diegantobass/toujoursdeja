LET ME SLEEP BESIDE YOU from The Gospel According To David Bowie 


MAIN RIFF x 2 into C

F                       C
Du du du du du du du du dum dum
F     C
Du du dum


C          Bb                F                   C
Baby, baby brush the dust of youth from off your shoulder
  C                  Bb                F              C
Because the years of threading daisies lie behind you now
C               Bb                    F               C
Don't return to fields of green where rainbow secrets were told
C                 Bb                F                   C
Place your ragged doll with all the toys and paints and beads
Gm                             F            C
I will show you games where the winner never wins


CHORUS 1:
Bb       F         C
Let your hair hang down
Bb       F          C
Wear the dress your Mother wore
Bb     F       C
Let me sleep beside you
F                       C
Du du du du du du du du dum dum
F     C
Du du dum


C              Bb            F              C
Lock away your childhood and throw away the key
    C                   Bb               F                 C
For now the streets and city sounds will burn your eyes as coals
C                   Bb              F                 C
You shall drink the oldest wine and velvet skies will linger
C               Bb             F                  C
Child, you're a woman now your heart and soul are free
Gm                             F               C
I will hold a lighted lamp and we shall walk together


CHORUS 2


     Bb                  C                 Bb               C
Your darkened eyes throw mystery, but your lips are void of history
F              Eb          Bb              F
You could not imagine that it could happen this way...could you?


HORNS:  C  Bb  F  C
        C  Bb  F  C


Gm                              F                     C
I will give you dreams and I'll tell you things you'd like to hear


CHORUS 3:
Bb       F         C
Let your hair hang down
Bb       F          C
Wear the dress your Mother wore
Bb     F       C
Let me sleep beside you
F                       C
Du du du du du du du du dum dum
F     C
Du du dum
Bb     F       C
Let me sleep beside you
