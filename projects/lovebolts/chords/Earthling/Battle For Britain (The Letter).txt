Highly techno piece of jungle beat music, but here's a good chord thing, and
it sounds cool by itself.
        -Ben Toomey

To David Bowie:  If you ever read this, e-mail me and tell me how I did, and
you will have made my year.  toomey@sos.net is the address.

There's an E based intro that you could play by doing an E(022100) all the
time, or make up for the loss of special effects by playing (X-12-11-12-12-12).

B             
My my, but time do fly
F#                           A     A
When it’s in another pair of hands
      B
And a loser I will be
         F# 
For I’ve never been a winner
      A    A
In my life
      B        
I got used to stressing pain
           F#
I used the sucker pills
                 A
And pity for the self
                B
Though it’s the animal in me
        F#
But I’d rather be a beggar man
       A       A
On the shelf

G
Don’t be so forlorn
              F#
It’s just the payoff
                         E
It’s the rain before the storm
     G
On a better day
                     F#        
I’ll take you by the hand
                       E
And lead you thru’ the doors
G
Don’t be so forlorn
              F#
It’s just the payoff
                         A
It’s the rain before the storm

C               
Don’t you let my letter
             G
Get you down
Bb F
   Don't you...

Intro thingy 4X or so

C               
Don’t you let my letter
             G
Get you down
Bb F
   Don't you...

B   
My my, but time do fly
F#                           A     A
When it’s in another pair of pants
     B   
And illusion I will be
         F#
For I’ve never been a sinner
      A   A
La-de-dah

G
Don’t be so forlorn
              F#
It’s just the payoff
                         E
It’s the rain before the storm

C               
Don’t you let my letter
             G
Get you down
Bb F
   Don't you...
   
C               
Don’t you let my letter
             G
Get you down
Bb F
   Don't you...

Intro thingy fade away
