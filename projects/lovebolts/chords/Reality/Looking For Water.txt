Still the leaves are spinning round 
                                    F#m
Take my hand as we go down and down and down - Looking for water
     D
When I last got in a New York minute 
                                                                      F#m
Don't know about you but my heart's not in it (Looking Looking Looking) 
I'm looking for water - I'm looking for water (Looking Looking Looking) 
  D
I can't breathe the air can't raise a fire
                                                   F#m
Cos all we got left is a beat in the night and I'm (Looking for water) 
Looking for water (Looking for water - Looking Looking) 
D
Take my hand as we go down and down
                                    F#m
Leave it all behind nothing will be found
(I'm Looking for water) I'm looking for water
                                       D
(Looking for water - Looking Looking - I'm Looking for water) 
Looking everywhere (Looking for water) 
                 F#m
Looking here and there (I'm Looking for water) 
I'm looking for water (Looking for water - Looking looking) 
        D
I can't live in this cage I can't eat this candy 
The ends of the earth to this beat in my head
  F#m
I look in your eyes and never means never
                                              D
The dawns early light, baby, dawn is wherever
                F#m
(Looking Looking) 
                 D F#m
(Looking Looking) 
(Looking for water - Looking Looking) 
 D

D
I'm Looking for water - Looking for water - Looking Looking
I'm Looking for water - Looking for water - Looking Looking
I'm Looking for water - Looking for water
