TELLING LIES

from the album EARTHLING (1997)

Transcribed by Camilo Alves

Intro: Am

E
Gorgeous girls are bound to meet
D
To talk of stars and kings and feet
Em                                    Bm
Through the chromosomes of space and time
E
Me I'm fast like bad infection
D
Gasping for my resurrection
E                                 Dm
Swear to me in times of war and stress


         Em   D
Telling lies

Am       
(Ooh, ah, visionary)
G
(Ooh, ah, missionary)

C                         D
(Feels like something's gonna happen this year)

Telling lies

(Ooh, ah, visionary)
(Ooh, ah, missionary)
Telling lies
(Feels like something's gonna happen this year)
Telling lies...


Shadow falls in shrinking smiles
See me poised at the happy games
Standing in the mouth of all that's pure
Come straggling in your tattered remnants
You'll come to me in tears and rain
I'm your future,
I'm tomorrow, I'm the end
