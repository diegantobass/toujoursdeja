VERSE:
   E            A           
Oh come all you children
      E                A
Don't grab that scabby hand
   E              A
It belongs to Mr. Sniff and Tell
   E                   A
It belongs to the candyman

etc

PRE-CHORUS
        F#
They're riding on the subways
        A
They're riding on the streets
        G  
They'll ride you down to the gutters
        B
They'll ride you off your feet

CHORUS
                E     A     E
Gonna hit Crack City
    A     E     A     E     A
Hit Crack City
