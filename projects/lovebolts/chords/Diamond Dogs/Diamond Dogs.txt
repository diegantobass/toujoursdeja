As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
    E
You asked for the latest party
          D 
With your silicone hump and your ten inch stump
A
Dressed like a priest you was, Tod Browning's freak you was
Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee
    E
I'm sure you're not protected, for it's plain to see
    D
The diamond dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
A
Hunt you to the ground they will, mannequins with kill appeal


CHORUS 1:
          E
Will they come...I'll keep a friend serene   
          G
Will they come...Oh baby, come unto me       
          A
Will they come...Well, she's come, been and gone
D
Come out of the garden, baby
A
You'll catch your death in the fog
      B          D                     A
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
      B          D                     A
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs


The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat
       E
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
    D
The elevator's broke, so he slides down a rope
A
Onto the street below, oh Tarzie, go man go
Meet his little hussy with his ghost town approach
E
Her face is sans feature, but she wears a Dali brooch
D
Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake
A
Wrecked up and paralyzed, Diamond Dogs are sableized


CHORUS 2


      E                          A
Oo oo ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
      E                          D
Oo oo ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs


INTRO


In the year of the scavenger, the season of the bitch
E
Sashay on the boardwalk, scurry to the ditch
D
Just another future song, lonely little kitsch
        A
There's gonna be sorrow try and wake up tomorrow


CHORUS 3


      E                          A
Oo oo ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
      E                          A
Oo oo ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
E                     A
Call them the Diamond Dogs, Dogs
E                     A
Call them the Diamond Dogs, call them, call them
E                     A
Call them the Diamond Dogs, call them, call them, oo
E                     D
Call them the Diamond Dogs
