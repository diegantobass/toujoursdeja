SLOW BURN from Heathen 


INTRO:  F  Am  x4

F                          Am
Here shall we live in this terrible town
          F                                     Am
Where the price for our eyes shall squeeze them tight like a fist
        F                             Am
And the walls shall have eyes and the doors shall have ears
          F                             Am
But we'll dance in the dark and they'll play with our lives


       Dm                   F
Like a Slow Burn leading us on and on and on
       Dm                   F
Like a Slow Burn turning us round and round and round
Bb                         Gm
But who are we so small in times such as these
     F    Am
Slow Burn
     F    Am
Slow Burn


SOLO: F  Am  F  Am


    F                                Am
Oh, these are the days these are the strangest of all
F                                  Am
These are the nights these are the darkest to fall
    F                   Am
But who knows echoes in tenement halls
F                    Am
Who knows though the years snare them all


       Dm                   F
Like a Slow Burn leading us on and on and on
       Dm                   F
Like a Slow Burn turning us round and round and upside down
        Bb                      Gm
There's fear over there there's fear over ground
     F    Am
Slow Burn
     F    Am
Slow Burn
       Dm                   F
Like a Slow Burn leading us on and on and on
       Dm                   F
Like a Slow Burn turning us round and round and round
    Bb                 Gm
And here are we at the center of it all
     F    Am
Slow Burn
     F    Am
Slow Burn
     F    Am
Slow Burn
