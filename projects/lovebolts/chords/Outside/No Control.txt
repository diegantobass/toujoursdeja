  A
  Stay away from the future,back away from the light,
             G            A 
  It's all deranged,no control..


  A
  Sit tight in your corner,don't tell God your plans,
             G            A
  It's all deranged,no control..


  G                                     F                        G
  If I could control tomorrows hate,the darkest shores would not bother me..
  G                                       F                    G
  If I can't control the web we weave ,my life will be lost in falling leaves..


  A
  Every single moves uncertain,don't tell God your plans,
             G             A
  It's all deranged, no control..


  G                                        F                G
  I shall live my life on bended knee,if I can't control my destiny,
  G                                                                           
  Youve gotta have a scheme,you've gotta have a plan, 
         F                     G
  in the world of today,for tommorrows man..

  
  ...no control...

  
  A
  Stay away from the future
