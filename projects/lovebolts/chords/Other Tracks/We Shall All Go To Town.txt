WE SHALL ALL GO TO TOWN 


INTRO:  F#  Bb  F#  Bb


        F#                   Bb
No more delight or crawling around
            F#           Bb
Whisper the word hold my hand
         F#              Bb
Never forget those who refuse you
         F#             Bb
Never forget who you've been
    F#                  Bb
And you will fight with demons
     F#          Bb
When we shall go to town
          F#              Bb
And we'll eat between the rich men
          F#                   Bb
And we'll drink if we don't go down


GUITAR:  F#  Bb  F#  Bb
         F#  Bb  G#m


           F#                 Bb
Follow the lights stay on the outside
         F#                Bb
The only way in is swollen with tears
            F#                      Bb
Don't bring your things just let me serve you
         F#          Bb
Only the fool turns around 
    F#                  Bb
And you will fight with demons
     F#             Bb
When we shall go to town
    F#                 Bb
And you will wear your best shoes
          F#                   Bb
And we'll dance if we don't go down
          F#                   Bb  F#  Bb
And we'll dance if we don't go down

Alain Valdes has written to me saying that there are errors in this song and 
that the correct chords are as follows: 
                Ebm                    Bb 
No more delight or crawling around
etc...
                Ab                        Bb
And we'll drink if we don't go down
