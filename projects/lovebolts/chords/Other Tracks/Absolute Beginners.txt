D		Bm
I´ve nothing much to offer
Amaj		Gdim
There´s nothing much to take
G		D
I´m an absolute beginner
C		Bm  Em A7
But I´m absolutely sane
D		Bm
As long as we´re together
Amaj		Gdim
The rest may go to hell
G		D		
I absolutely love you
C		Bm
But we´re absolute beginners
G		D
With eyes completely open
F#		A
But nerveous all the same

Chorus:
A	D
If our love song 
D		G
Could fly over mountains
G		Bm
Could laugh at the ocean
Bm		F#
Just like the films
Em A7		D
There´s no reason 
D		G
To feel all the hard times
G		Bm
To lay down the hard lines 
Bm		A|A Asus|A|A Asus|
It´s absolutely true

D		Bm
Nothing much could happen
Amaj		Gdim
Nothing we can´t shake
G		D
Though we´re absolute beginners
C		Bm Em A7
With nothing much at stake
D		Bm
As long a you´re still smiling
Amaj		Gdim
There´s nothing more I need
G		D
I absolutely love you
C		Bm		
But we´re absolute beginners
G		D
But if my love is your love
F#		A
We´re certain to succeed


Chorus:
A	D
If our love song 
D		G
Could fly over montains
G		Bm
Could sail over heartaches
Bm		F#
Just like the films
Em A7		D
If there´s reasons 
D		G
To feel all the hard times
G		Bm
To lay down the hard lines
Bm		A
It´s absolutely true
