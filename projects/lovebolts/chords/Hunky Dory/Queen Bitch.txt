        C  G  F  C  G  F
        C  G  F  C  G  F


    C                                F                       C   G  F  C  G  F
I'm up on the eleventh floor and I'm watching the cruisers below
     C                           F                             C  G  F  C  G  F
He's down on the street and he's trying hard to pull sister Flo
       C                          F                        C  G  F  C  G  F
Oh, My heart's in the basement my weekend's at an all time low
             C                    F                           
'Cause she's hoping to score so I can't see her letting him go
C               E                     A
Walk out of her heart walk out of her mind, Oh not her


CHORUS 1:
         B                       D          B                                D
She's so swishy in her satin and tat in her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat
       B                      C  G  F  C  G  F  C  G  F  C  G  F
Oh God I could do better than that



         C                      F                                C  G  F  C  G  F
She's an old time ambassador of sweet talking night walking games
              C                              F                        C  G  F  C  G  F
Oh, and she's known in the darkest clubs for pushing ahead of the dames
       C                          F                          C  G  F  C  G  F
If she says she can do it she can do it she don't make false claims
            C                                   F                           E
For she's a queen and such are queens that your laughter is sucked in their brains
                      F                           C
Now she's leading him on and she'll lay him right down 
                       F                           E
Yeah she's leading him on and she'll lay him right down
                       F                         C
But it could have been me yes it could have been me 
             E                A
Why did'nt I say why did'nt I say, No, no, no


CHORUS 2


     C                      F                    C  G  F  C  G  F
So I lay down a while and I gaze at my hotel wall
       C                 F                            C  G  F  C  G  F 
Oh the cot is so cold it don't feel like no bed at all
     C                    F                    C  G  F  C  G  F
Yeah, I lay down a while and look at my hotel wall
         C                       F                            E
And he's down on the street so I throw both his bags down the hall
                  F                          C
And I'm phoning a cab cause my stomach feels small
                      F                          E
There's a taste in my mouth and it's no taste at all  
                          F                          C
It could have been and yes it could have been me 
             E                A
Why did'nt I say why did'nt I say, No, no, no
