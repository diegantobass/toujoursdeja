*** Try Some, Buy Some ***

Originally a George Harrison song

I'm sure some of this isn't quite right, but it works...!

A slash (/) implies an altered bass - for example Dm/C# is a D minor chord with a C# in the bass...


Dm          Dm/C#
Way back in time

             Dm/C
Someone said try some

  Dm/B
I tried some

    Dm/Bb       Dm/A
Now buy some, I bought some...

A7
Oh oh oh

Gm      Gm(maj7)
After a while

           Gm7         Gm6
When I had tried them, denied them

  Gm(#5)    Gm/Bb      Gdim7   Bbdim7          F
I opened my eyes and I saw you...


F                 F       F/E       F/D        F/C
Not a thing did I have

                  F(#5)   F(#5)/E   F(#5)/C#   F(#5)/A
Not a thing did I see

                       Bbm/F   Bbm/Eb   Bbm/Db   Bbm
'Till I called on your love

                      Fdim7   Fdim7/D   Fdim7/C   Fdim7/B
And your love came to me

         Bdim7
Oh oh oh oh oh

         Ddim7
Oh oh oh oh oh

F   F/E   F/D   F/C   Bdim7
             Oh oh oh ohhh

F   F/E   F/D   F/C

Through my life
I've seen grey sky, met big fry
Seen them die to get high...
Ohhh
And when it seemed that I would only be lonely
I opened my eyes and I saw you

Not a thing did I feel
Not a thing did I know
'Till I called on your love
And your love sure did grow
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh ohhh

          F   F/E   F/D   F/C ...etc
Won't you try some
Baby won't you buy some
Won't you try some
Baby won't you buy some
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh ohhh



Have fun...
