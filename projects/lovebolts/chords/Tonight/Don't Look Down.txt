DON'T LOOK DOWN

                        Em9           Em11
              Am7 
Don't look down-
                         Em7
They're making sort of crazy sounds-
              Am7        Gmaj9
Don't look down-    No-
               Am7                        Gmaj9
Don't know who else came to kneel on this empty battle-field
           Am7                             Em7 
But when I hear that crazy sound-  I don't look down
                            Am7
from Central Park to Shanty Town-
                   Em7                                  Am7
I always hear that crazy sound from New York to Shanty Town-
Bm7     Cmaj7   C6/D         Gmaj9
There's always something else-
             Am7             Gmaj9
Don't look down-    No-
             Am7
I went this morning to the cemetery
           Gmaj9
To see old Rudy Valentino buried
          Am7
Lip-stick traces on his name
                Em7 
He never looked down
                         Am7
'Cause they were making crazy sounds-
                         Em7
From Central Park to Shanty Town
                       Am7
He always heard that crazy sound-
Bm7     Cmaj7   C6/D         Gmaj9                Am7        Gmaj9 
There's always something else-     Don't look down-    No-
       Am7                              Am7
When I see you standing there   I can't see the clothes you wear
        Am7                                  Em7
I just hear-  that crazy sound-  And I can't look down-
                         Am7                                 Em7 
From Central Park to Shanty Town-   I've always heard that crazy sound-
                         Am7
From New York to Shanty Town-
Bm7     Cmaj7   C6/D          Gmaj9               Am7        Gmaj9 
There's always something else-     Don't look down-    No-
               Am7     Gmaj9                      Am7        Gmaj9 
Don't look down-                   Don't look down-
              Am7                                 Gmaj9
No I won't be bored, I won't be there, Look at life,- It's no piece of cake-
       Am7                                  Em7 
When I hear that crazy sound-  I don't look down-
                  Am7                Gmaj9
From Central Park to Shanty Town-
               Am7                   Gmaj9
Don't look down-          No-  

                                 Am7           Bm7  Cmaj7  C6/D  N.C. 
Well, Don't look, Don't look down-
