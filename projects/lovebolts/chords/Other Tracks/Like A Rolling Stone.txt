I remember requesting Like a Rolling Stone a few weeks back; since then a
few other people have done the same. I got this response after I posted on

complete lyrics; there not at Nevada. If someone could please post or send
them to me I'd appreciate it. Here it is..

You used to laugh about ...

F       Em    Dm      C
Now you don't talk ...

F       Em    Dm      C
Now you don't ...

Dm7                 F                       G
