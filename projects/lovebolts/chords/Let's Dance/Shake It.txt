Shake It
Lyrics and music by David Bowie
 

Intro: F E

G F#m F E G F#m F

              E
I feel like a sail-boat
              G
Adrift on the sea
       G     F#m F 
It's a brand new day
                  E          G F#m F
So when you gonna phone me


                    E
I could take you to heaven
                    G
I could spin you to hell
         G    F#m    F
But I'll take you to New York
                      E           G F#m F E 
It's the place that I know well



 G                                  G   F#m  F     E
Sitting on a flagstone talking to a faceless girl
G                                                   C
Wondering what to say but my eyes do the talking so well



C                             C
I duck and I sway - what's my line
C                                C
Shoot at a full moon - what's my line
                          G
What's my line - shake it baby


G F#m F

                  E
Cause love is the answer
                  G
Love's talking to me
    G          F#m  F
I'd scream and I'll fight for you
                   E       G F#m F E
You're better than money
G                                                  G  F#m  F    E
We're the kind of people who can shake it if we're feeling blue
         G                                     G    F#m F   E
When I'm feeling disconnected well I sure know what to do
         G
Shake it baby



C                             C
I duck and I sway - what's my line
C                                C
Shoot at a full moon - what's my line
                 G
What's my line - shake it baby


G F#m F E G F#m F E (repeat)
