CACTUS from Heathen 


INTRO:  A

A
Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
     C                       A
Just wishing that I had just something you wore
  C      A         C      A
I put it on when I go lonely
         Dm9           F         G          A
Will you take off your dress and send it to me

A
I miss your kissing and I miss your head
      C                             A
And a letter in your writing doesnt mean your not dead
     C      A           C      A
Just run outside in the desert heat
          Dm9       F       G          A
Make your dress all wet and send it to me

A  Dm9  C  A

A                      Dm9
I miss your soup and I miss your bread
      C                             A                  Dm9  A
And a letter in your writing doesnt mean your not dead
   C          A             C         A
So spill your breakfast and drip your wine
     Dm9       F              G    A
Just wear that dress when you di-i-ine

So bloody your hands on the cactus tree

Wipe it on your dress and send it to me
