INTRO: Em (Then the drums crash in and...) C Am

C
Eddie boy lit like paraffin spending two weeks in a crack house
                        Am
Burns on his brain like Chernobyl
C
Dean was seen with a two bag purchase he was lying dead on his mother's bed
                Am 
Someone to pray for-till I met you

Dm
Life is like a broken arrow
F
memory a swingin' door
Dm
I could be your great misfortune
F                                         C
I can make you happy every day of your life

C           Am   F                    C
  Making my love   like a shining star
          Am   F                     C
Taking my love   just a touch too far

Tessie turns tricks with a soul like ice cause love left holes
And four swell kids breaking her heart
I've got windows, I've seen much vice, I've touched down with vermin,
Cowardice, lice,
And I say

Nobody cares what you do
please be yourself to death
I could be your great misfortune
But you'll never find a
bet you'll never find a better man.

C           Am   F                    C
  Making my love   like a shining star
          Am   F                     C
Taking my love   just a touch too far


Peter met Frank formed a dummy run gang
Worked heist or hit for 10 g's flat
Blew heads outta shape for the name of Trotsky,
Sinn-Fein, Hitler cashdown
No hope heroes cover this page with depts in hell
And fingers in blood
Poor little bodies all covered in scabs
threw it all away

Have a life in the grave
Have a life in the grave

Life is like a broken arrow
memory a swingin' door
I could be your great misfortune
Well I could make you happy every goddamn single day of your life
