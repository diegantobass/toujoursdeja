MY DEATH from '72 


INTRO:  Em  Em7  Em6  Emdim6
        Em  Em7  Em6  Emdim6


Em Em7         Em6  Emdim6    Em
My death waits like an old rou√©
Em7     Em6 Emdim6       Em
So confident I'll go his way
Em7        Em6 Emdim6  D           Dsus4  D
Whistle to him and the passing time
G  Am7         A            G
My death waits like a bible truth
Am     F             Am   Am/G
At the funeral of my youth
   F                      G
We drank for that and the passing time
G#m      F#                    G#m
My death waits like a witch at night
   F#                    G#m
As surely as our love is bright
F#                             B
Let's not think of that or the passing time


CHORUS 1:
Em                D
But what ever lies behind the door
C        C/B             B
There is nothing much to do
Em              D
Angel or devil, I don't care
C      C/B               Am Am/G     B
For in front of that door,  there is you


BREAK:  Bb  C


Gm
My death waits like a beggar blind
Who sees the world through an unlit mind
                         F
Throw him a dime for the passing time
Bb             C           Bb
My death waits to allow my friends
  G#                       Cm
A few good times before it ends
              G#                      Bb
Ah, let's not think about the passing time
Bm             A                  Bm
My death waits there between your thighs
          A                     Bm
Your cool fingers will close my eyes
          A               F#
Let's think of that, and the passing time


CHORUS 2:
Gm                F
But what ever lies behind the door
Eb                       D
There is nothing much to do
Gm              F
Angel or devil, I don't care
Eb                                   D
For in front of that door,  there is you


Gm
My death waits there among the leaves
In magicians' mysterious sleeves
                         F
Rabbits and dogs and the passing time
Bb             C               Bb
My death waits there among the flowers
          G#              Cm
Where the blackest shadow cowers
              G#             Bb
 let's pick lilacs for the passing time
Bm             A                 Bm
My death waits there in a double bed
      A                 Bm
Sails of oblivion at my head
          A               F#
So, pull up the sheets against the passing time


CHORUS 3:
Gm                F
But what ever lies behind the door
Eb                       D
There is nothing much to do
Gm              F
Angel or devil, I don't care
Eb                                   D
For in front of that door...there is you
