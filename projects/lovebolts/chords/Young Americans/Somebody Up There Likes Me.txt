SOMEBODY UP THERE LIKES ME From Young Americans


INTRO:  D  E  B   x6

TIP: By the third time the progression ends, a synth is layered in behind the sax.  To imitate it, play the B as a
Barre chord (7th fret, E pattern) and for the second bar of B take your middle finger off the 8th fret, 3rd string (creating a temporary B minor Barre chord) ,for one strum, then hammer it back on.
