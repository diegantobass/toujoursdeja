     Intro D Em7 Gdim
  
 D                         Em7
     Living in lies by the railway line
 Gdim                         D
     Pushing the hair from my eyes
                          Em7
     Elvis is English and climbs the hills
 Gdim                                  D
     Can't tell the bullshit from the lies
                             Em7
    Screaming along in South London
    Gdim                 D
    Vicious but ready to learn
                              Em7
    Sometimes I fear that the whole world is queer
    Gdim                    Bm  
    Sometimes but always in vain
 
Dm7                          Bm
    So I'll wait until we're sane
    Dm7                                  Bm
    Wait until we're blessed and all the same
    Dm7                            Bm    
    Full of blood, loving life and all it's got to give
    Dm7                G
    Englishmen going insane
    
    Down on my knees in suburbia
                             A    Gmaj7  A  Gmaj7  A Gmaj7
    Down on myself in every way

         D                    Em7
    With great expectations I change all my clothes
            Gdim                  D
    Mustn't grumble at silver and gold
                            Em7
    Screaming above Central London
          Gdim                    Bm
    Never born, so I'll never get old

 Dm7                         Bm
    So I'll wait until we're sane
    Dm7                                  Bm
    Wait until we're blessed and all the same
    Dm7                            Bm
    Full of blood, loving life and all it's got to give
    Dm7                G
    Englishmen going insane
    
    Down on my knees in suburbia
                             A   Gmaj7   A
    Down on myself in every way
