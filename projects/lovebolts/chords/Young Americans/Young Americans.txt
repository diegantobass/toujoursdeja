YOUNG AMERICANS From Young Americans


INTRO: C  Dm  F  G
       C  Dm  F  G


C                                        Dm
They pulled in just behind the bridge he lays her down, he frowns
F                               G
Gee my life's a funny thing, am I still too young?
C                                         Dm
He kissed her then and there she took his ring, took his babies
   F                                   G
It took him minutes, took her nowhere, Heaven knows, she'd have taken anything, but


CHORUS
F   G
All night, she wants the young American
C                      Dm
Young American, young American, she wants the young American
F   G
All night, she wants the young American


C                                            Dm
Scanning life through the picture window She finds the slinky vagabond
   F                                         G
He coughs as he passes her Ford Mustang, but Heaven forbid, she'll take anything
C                                                Dm
But the freak, and his type, all for nothing, he misses a step and cuts his hand, but
F                                                 G
Showing nothing, he swoops like a song she cries "Where have all Papa's heroes gone?"


CHORUS
F   G
All night, she wants the young American
C                      Dm
Young American, young American, she wants the young American
F   G
All right, she wants the young American


C                               Dm
All the way from Washington her bread-winner begs off the bathroom floor
   F                                      G
We live for just these twenty years do we have to die for the fifty more?


CHORUS
F   G
All night he wants the young American
C                      Dm
Young American, young American, he wants the young American
F   G
All right he wants the young American

Do you remember, your President Nixon?
Am       Em          F                             E
Do you remember, the bills you have to pay or even yesterday?

Have you have been an un-American? Just you and your idol singing falsetto 'bout
G                                A
Leather, leather everywhere, and not a myth left from the ghetto
D                                         Em
Well, well, well, would you carry a razor in a case, just in case of depression?
G                                       A
Sit on your hands on a bus of survivors blushing at all the afro-Sheeners
D                               Em
Ain't that close to love? Well, ain't that poster love?
G                                                       A
Well, it ain't that Barbie doll her heart's been broken just like you have

G   A
All night you want the young American
D                      Em

G   A
All right you want the young American


D                                           Em
You ain't a pimp and you ain't a hustler, a pimp's got a Cadi and a lady got a Chrysler
G                                                   A
Black's got respect, and white's got his soul train Mama's got cramps, and look at your hands ache
D                          Em
I heard the news today, oh boy I got a suite and you got defeat
G                                           A
Ain't there a man you can say no more? And, ain't there a woman I can sock on the jaw?
     D                                               Em
And, ain't there a child I can hold without judging? Ain't there a pen that will write before they die?
G                                            A
Ain't you proud that you've still got faces? Ain't there one damn song that can make me break down and cry?
