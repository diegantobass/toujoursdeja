Intro and verses and chorus: Em C (that's almost the whole damn song)


Wow this ain't the right thing to do so let's go

Em         D                            C
Young girls they know what they're after
Em         D                      C
Young girls don't kiss me goodbye
Em      D                       C
Rockets shooting up into space  
E         D                    C
Buildings they rise to the skies              (The entire song on all verse's had the D in place)

Em        D          C
Bang Bang I got mine
Em        D                  C
Bang Bang reach for the sky
          
I keep a good friend on videotape                         
He'll drive his sports car until it's too late
But we'll have a hot time on the town tonight
Cause love is my bet and it's the best yet
Bang Bang I got mine
Bang Bang sun don't shine
Bang Bang you all angels
Bang Bang now you all ought to be in pictures

G       C (The "ooohh ohh" part... finally some other chords)

Em     C
Oh girl
Em      C
Oh girl my problems can't follow me
Em                           C
Phone calls I take my machine
Em                        C
I wander lonely to the sea
Em                             C
Lonely-Ha Ha-what does it mean

Bang Bang I got mine
Bang Bang and you are next in line
Bang Bang reach for the sky
Bang Bang sun don't shine

G     
Rise buildings
C
Rise to the sky

Em                                     C
Young girls they know what they're after
Em                                      C
I said, young girls don't kiss me goodbye

G  C

Ok, that would be all. I transcribed almost the whole Never let me down album 

(except "Never let me down" and "Day in-Day out"). I know it's not the best 

Bowie's album, in fact, it's his worst... but if you compare it with most of 

the music around lately... it's Mozart.

Bye!
