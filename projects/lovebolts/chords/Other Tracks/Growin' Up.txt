GROWIN' UP

       A           E       B       E
Well I stood stone like at midnight 
  A          E        B   E
Suspended in my masquerade
  A         E                B         E
I combed my hair till it was just right
       A          E            B  E
And commanded the night brigade
      A       E        B              E
I was open to pain and crossed by the rain
      A           E             B  E
And I walked on a crooked crutch
  A             E              B       E
I strolled all alone through a fallout zone
         A           D      E       A  E
And came out with my soul untouched
A B
I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd
              A                     C#m
But when they said sit down I stood up
A   B   A       E  B  E    A  E  B  E
Ooh-ooh growin' up


    A       E           B       E
The flag of piracy flew from my mast
   A              E           B  E
My sails were set wing to wing
        A       E        B           E
I had a jukebox graduate for a first mate
             A            E    B     E
She couldn't sail but she sure could sing
           A  E               B             E
I pushed a B-52 and bombed em with the blues
        A        E           B       E
With my gear set stubborn on standing
        A            E            B        E
I broke all the rules, strafed my old high school
      A         D          E      A  E
Never once gave thought to landing
A B
I hid in the clouded warmth of the crowd
              A                      C#m
But when they said come down I threw up
A   B   A       E  B  E    A  E  B  E
Ooh-ooh growin' up

       A  E  B  E


       A            E              B           E
I took month long vacations in the stratosphere
              A              E               B  E
You know it's really hard to hold your breath
              A         E            B              E
And I swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared
          A            E     B            E
I was the cosmic kid in full costume dress
        A                 E         B           E
Well my feet they finally took root in the earth
            A           E            B    E
And I got a nice little place in the stars
      A                 E          B       E
And I swear I found the key to the universe
       A            D          E  A  E
In the engine of an old parked car
A B
I hid in the mother breast of the crowd
              A                       C#m
But when they said pull down I pulled up
A   B   C#m        B
Ooh-ooh growin' up
A   B   A         E  B  E
Ooh-ooh growin' up
