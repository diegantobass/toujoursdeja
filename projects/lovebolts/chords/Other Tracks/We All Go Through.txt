We All Go Through

E                 D
Skeletal city highs
               A
Crazies with dumb replies
G          A
Nobody's eyes anymore

Frown on your beggar's face
Walking this lunarscape
Nothing in my lackaday

CHORUS
C
  We'll all be right
D
  We'll all be right
E
  We'll all be right in the now
C
  We all go through
D
  We all go through
E
  We all go through it sometimes

Somebody's space to rent
Somebody's soul to dent
Dog is in every word

Hiding the flames of power
Hiding us home by home
Nearly got out yesterday

CHORUS
C            D               A
Trouble it travels on the wing
             G
Doorway to door
            F#
Open your eyes
            F
Nothing remains
E
A secret love between us

Nothing can hide for long
We are the morning song
Holding my breath anyway

CHORUS (x2)
