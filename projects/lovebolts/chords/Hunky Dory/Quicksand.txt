QUICKSAND from Hunky Dory 

**fixed by DJB**


INTRO:  G  Am7  G  Am7  G  Am7  G  Am7


    C
I'm closer to the golden dawn 
                                 G        Gsus4  G
Immersed in Crowley's uniform of imagery
    C
I'm living in a silent film
                                       G
Portraying Himmler's sacred realm of dream reality
    Eb 
I'm frightened by the total goal
F*
Drawing to the ragged hole
      G             Em        C
And I ain't got the power any more
                             G    Am7  Am7add9  Am7add9*  A
no I ain't got the power any more


        D
I'm the twisted name on Garbo's eyes
                                    A       Asus4  A
Living proof of Churchills lies I'm destiny
    D
I'm torn between the light and dark
                                     A        Asus4  A
Where others see their target divine symmetry
F
Should I kiss the vipers fang
   G
Or herald loud the death of man?
    A              F#m             D
I'm sinking in the quicksand of my thoughts
                              A    Asus4  A
And I ain't got the power any more


CHORUS 1:
A         E          F#m
Don't believe in yourself
         D#dim        E
Don't deceive with belief
          A#dim                Bm
Knowledge comes with deaths release
   D#dim   A
Ah ah ah   ah
   F#m    C#m  E
Ah ah ah   ah  ah


    D
I'm not a prophet or a stone-age man
                                              A
Just a mortal with potential of a superman I'm living on
    D
I'm tethered to the logic of homo sapien
                                               A
Can't take my eyes from the great salvation of bullshit faith
     F
If I don't explain what you ought to know 
        G
You can tell me all about it in the next bardot
    A              F#m             D
I'm sinking in the quicksand of my thoughts
                              A    Asus4  A  Asus4  A
And I ain't got the power any more


CHORUS 2 and 3 

CHORUS 4 - No vocals

-----------------------------------------
INTRO: The notes that double the chords are just 'G' and 'A' They're played on 
some sort of vibe. 

Ain't got the power...bit: You know, the bit where the guitar strums heavy and 
then plays harmonics at the fifth fret. In case you don't know, harmonics are 
achieved by holding your finger gently on the string directly above the fret, 
and sort of pulling it away as you play the note! (easier said than done 
probably!)
