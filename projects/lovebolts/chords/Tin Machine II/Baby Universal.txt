Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby ect ect 

A                              F#
Now that he has no sense of destination
A                              F#
Now he's running for the love of speed
A                                        F#
When the child goes bad it's no cause for celebration
A                                  F#
Like Jimmy Dean he don't talk back to me

E
Failures as fathers, Mothers to chaos
No baby, no baby, no baby no

CHORUS
  A                             G
  Hello humans can you feel me thinking
  A                                    G
  I assume you're seeing everything I'm thinking
  A                             G
  Hello humans nothing starts tomorrow
               E
  I'm the baby now

  Baby (repeat to end of chorus)  

 (And so on for rest of song)
  
  Baby Universe
  Baby Universe
  Baby Universal


A speck of dust just settled in my eye
It doesn't matter I've seen everything anyway

Failures as fathers, Mothers to chaos
No baby, no baby, no baby no

CHORUS
