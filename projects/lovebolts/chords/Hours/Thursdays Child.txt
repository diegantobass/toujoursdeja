THURSDAY'S CHILD from Hours 


INTRO:  F#  D#m7  C#  B
        F#  D#m7  C#  B
 

F#        E                  F#
All of my life I've tried so hard
         C#m               D
Doing my best with what I had
             C#               D    G#
Nothing much happened all the same
F#         E              F#
Something about me stood apart
             C#m                  D
A whisper of hope that seemed to fail
          C#                   G#
Maybe I'm born right out of my time
         B             F#
Breaking my life in two
 

CHORUS 1:
F#         C#    
Throw me tomorrow
B             G#           F#
Now that I've really got a chance
           C#
Throw me tomorrow
Bb           G#           F#
Everything's falling into place
           C#
Throw me tomorrow
B         G#             F#
Seeing my past to let it go
           C#
Throw me tomorrow
Bb       G#    F#      B
Only for you I don't regret
           F#
That I was Thursday's child


D#m7    C#       B                   F#
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was
D#m7    C#       B                   F#
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was

 
            E                 F#
Sometimes I cried my heart to sleep
          C#m                D
Shuffling days and lonesome nights
             C#                 D   G#
Sometimes my courage fell to my feet
F#        E            F#
Lucky old sun is in my sky
           C#m                D
Nothing prepared me for your smile
             C#             G#
Lighting the darkness of my soul
             B        F#
Innocence in your arms

D#m7    C#       B                   F#
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was
D#m7    C#       B                   F#

Martin Lorimer has this to say:
"I'm sure most of the C# are C#m in the verse and first bit of chorus. and some 
of the G# are minors as well. The D#m7 also sounds better as a minor chord." 
Ralph Vidmar comments:
I would also use a barre chord for D (557775) instead of the open chord.  Flows better with the progression.
As in the Intro, I was hearing this chording here:

Bb       D#m    C#      B
Only for you I don't regret
           F#
That I was Thursday's child
