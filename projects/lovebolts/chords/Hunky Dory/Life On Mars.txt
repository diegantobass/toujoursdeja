LIFE ON MARS? from Hunky Dory 
(it's all down a half step from here... plus one chord is different on "is there life on Mars... the 2nd chors isn't diminished, it's augmented... could be more but don't have time to check.  Good job. This is a tough one.)




F         Am/E              F7/Eb
   It's a God awful small affair 
       D                     Gm
To the girl with the mousy hair  
        Gm/F             C/E
But her mummy is yelling no
          C7                    F
And her daddy has told her to go
        Am/E                     F7/Eb
But her friend is nowhere to be seen 
        D                           Gm
Now she walks through her sunken dream
       Gm/F                    C/E
To the seat with the clearest view
            C7                  Ab/Eb
And she's hooked to the silver screen
          Edim7             Fm
But the film is a saddening bore
          Ab/Gb                  Db
For she's lived it ten times or more
          Adim7                Bbm
She could spit in the eyes of fools
         Db/Cb
As they ask her to focus on


CHORUS 1:
Bb      Eb
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Gm      Ebm/F#                F
Oh man look at those cavemen go
Fm6                 Cm7
It's the freakiest show
Ebm7               Bb     Eb
Take a look at the lawman beating up the wrong guy
Gm      Ebm/F#               F
Oh man wonder if he'll ever know
Fm6                       Cm7
He's in the best selling show
Ebm7             Gm    F#aug  Bb  Edim7
Is there life on mars?


SOLO:  F  F#dim  Gm  G#dim  Am  Bb  Bbm


F           Am/E                 F7/Eb
    It's on Americas tortured brow
            D                        Gm
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
        Gm/F                       C/E
Now the workers have struck for fame
    C7                   F
Cos Lennon's on sale again
        Am/E                   F7/Eb
See the mice in their million hoards 
      D                       Gm
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
         Gm/F              C/E
Rule Brittannia is out of bounds 
      C7                 Ab/Eb
To my mother my dog and clowns
        Edim7               Fm
But the film is a saddening bore
         Ab/Gb                Db
Cause I wrote it ten times or more
      Adim7            Bbm  
It's about to be writ again
         Db/Cb
As they ask her to focus on

Bb      Eb
Sailors fighting in the dance hall

Take a look at the lawman beating up the wrong guy
Gm     Ebm/F#                F
Oh man wonder if he'll ever know
Fm6                       Cm7
He's in the best selling show
Ebm7             Gm    F#dim7  Bb  Edim7
Is there life on mars?

NOTES:
I'm a piano guy and I corrected the chords.  Sorry if you guitar players are confused by this.  The letter written after the "/" means this is the bass note.  So a Db/B is simply a Db with a B as the bass note.
