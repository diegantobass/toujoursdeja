Eb7
Getting my facts from a Benneton ad
I'm lookin' thru African eyes
Lit by the glare of an L.A. fire
Black tie white noise
I've got a face, not just my race, Bang Bang I've got you babe
G6
 Putting on the black tie
          F#m7
Crankin up the white noise

Eb7
Sun comes up and the man goes down
And the woman comes again
Just an hour or so to be safe from fear
Black tie white noise
Then we jump thru hoops, we're divisable now, just disappear
G6
 Putting on the black tie
          F#m7
Crankin up the white noise

         Abmaj7
We reach out over race and hold each other's hands
     Fm7                                     Dbmaj7
Then die in the flames singing "we shall overcome"
             Abmaj7
Whoa! What's going on?
Fm7                               Dbmaj7
 There'll be some blood no doubt about it
But we'll come thru don't doubt it
  Abmaj7
I look into your eyes and I know you won't kill me
  Fm7                                      Dbmaj7
I look into your eyes and I know you won't kill me
You won't kill me

Eb7
 You won't kill me no
But I look into your eyes
And I wonder sometimes
G6
 Putting on the black tie
          F#m7
Crankin up the white noise

Eb7
 Oh Lord, just let him see me
Lord, Lord just let him hear me
Let him call me brother
Let him put his arms around me
G6                       F#m7
Let him put his hands together.

Abmaj7                                    Fm7
Reach out over race and hold each other's hands
                                            Dbmaj7
Walk thru the nite thinking we are the world
             Abmaj7
Whoa! What's going on?
Fm7                                Dbmaj7
There will be some blood no doubt about it
                           Abmaj7
But we'll come thru don't doubt it
I look into your eyes and I know you won't kill me
      Fm7                                      Dbmaj7
And I turn my back for I know you won't kill me
You won't kill me

Eb7
You won't kill me no
But I wonder why
Yes, I wonder why sometimes
G6
 Putting on the black tie
          F#m7
Crankin up the white noise

        Eb7
They'll show us how to break the rules
But never how to make the rules
Reduce us down to witless punks
Black tie white noise                                                   G6
Fascist cries both black and white, who's got the blood, who's got the gun.
                                   F#m7
Putting on the black tie, cranking out the white noise
   Eb7
Oh yeah

Cranking out

Cranking out

Cranking out white noise

Black tie white noise

cranking out

cranking out

G6
 Putting on the black tie
          F#m7
Crankin up the white noise

Eb7
  cranking out

cranking out

Cranking out white noise

Black tie white noise

cranking out

cranking out
