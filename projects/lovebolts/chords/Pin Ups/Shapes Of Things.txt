SHAPES OF THINGS from Pin Ups 


INTRO:  F


D         Am               D
Shapes of things before my eyes
     Am             D
Just teach me to despise
     Am                 C
Will time make man more wise
D        Am           D
Here within my lonely frame
   Am                D
My eyes just hurt my brain
    Am               C
But will it seem the same

CHORUS 1:
C                Bb
(Come tomorrow), will I be older
C                Bb
(Come tomorrow), maybe a soldier
C                Bb              Bb   Bb  D
(Come tomorrow), may I be bolder than to..day


D       Am               D
Now the trees are almost green
    Am                 D
But will they still be seen
     Am                 C
When time and tide have been
D     Am              D
Boy into your passing hands
       Am                  D
Please don't destroy these lands
      Am               C
Don't make them desert sands


CHORUS 2


SOLO:  D  C  D  C  D  C  D  C
       D  C  D  C  D  C  Bb  Bb  D


D      Am               D
Soon I hope that I will find
  Am             D
A seed within my mind
     Am                C
That won't disgrace my kind
