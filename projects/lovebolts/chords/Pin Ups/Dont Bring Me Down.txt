DON'T BRING ME DOWN from Pin Ups 


INTRO:  A  E D C  A


E   D  C  A    E D     C  A
I'm on my own, nowhere to roam
E D    C   A     E     D    C  A
I tell you baby, don't want no home
A C  C#  D
I wander round, feet off the ground
E D  C   A  E    D    C  A   
I e..ven go from town to town
A C    D E
I said I think this rock is grand
D
Say I'll be your man
E     D     C  A     E     D     C  A
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down


E D   C    A      E   D  C  A
I met this chick, the other day
E   D    C  A   E   D    C      A
And then to me, she said she'll stay
A C   C#   D
I get this pad, just like a cave
E   D    C     A     E   D  C   A
And then we'll have, our living made
A   C    D    E
And then I'll lead her on the ground
   D
My head is spinning round
E     D     C  A     E     D     C  A
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down


HARMONICA:  D  A  E  D  A  E D C  A

I need a lover 'cause someone new
E   D    C  A   E D    C  A
And then to her I will be true
A    C   C#  D
I'll buy her furs and pretty things
E    D  C   A   E D  C    A
I'll e..ven buy a wedding ring
A   C D   E
But until then I'll settle down?
D
Say I'll be your man
A
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
      E
Until then I'll settle down?
D
Say I'll be your man

Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
E     D     C  A
Don't bring me down
