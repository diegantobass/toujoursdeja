Bm            F#m      A
Don't talk of dust and roses
Bm           F#m        A
Or should we powder our noses
               G
Don't live for last year's capers
        D                             E
Give me steel, give me steel, give me pulsars unreal
Bm            F#m    A
He'll build a glass asylum
Bm          F#m     A
With just a hint of mayhem
              G
He'll build a better whirlpool
         D                            E
We'll be living from sin, then we can really begin
D              G             D  G
Please savior, saviour, show us

Hear me, I'm graphically yours

Someone to shame us, some brave Apollo
           Bm       G            A
Someone to fool us, someone like you

But you made everyone and you've been every where
C                 G               D                 A
