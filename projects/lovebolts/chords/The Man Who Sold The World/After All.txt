Please trip them gently they don't like to fall 
Em Em7 F
Oh by  jingo

We're painting our faces and dressing in thoughts from the skies from paradise
     D7                         Em                   F  
They think that we're holding a secretive ball won't someone invite them 
        G                    Am        Am/G   Am/F#  Am/F
They're just taller children that's all after all

Man is an obstacle sad as the clown 
Em Em7 F
Oh by  jingo

     C                     G                        E   E7     Am  Am/G
Some people are marching together and some on their own quite alone
D7                     Em                     F
Others are running the smaller ones crawl but some sit in silence
        G                   Am        Am/G   Am/F#  Am/F
They're just older children that's all after all

  C                      G                   E      E7      Am   Am/G
I sing with impertinence shading impermanent chords with my words
     D7                         Em
I've borrowed your time and I'm sorry I called
        F                               G                    Am Am/G   Am/F#  Am/F
But the thought just occured that we're nobody's children at all after all
