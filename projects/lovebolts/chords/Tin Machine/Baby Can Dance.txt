this one is fairly simple it starts with:

intro
|B   |D   |A  |A  this twice

then those guitar parts:

E chord then move it up one fret so you'll get :

e-0
b-0
g-2
d-3
a-3
e-0

this goes one for a while then the verse starts which is 

A
I'm rolling down the ferris wheel 

A
no-one looks and no-one feels, 

            G
but the baby can, the baby can

A
The way I feel I'm feeling you 

A
holding out and falling out, 

            G
but the baby can, the baby can

A
I'm the jumping man

A
I'm the jumping man

Then you get the chorus which are the same as the intro sequence
