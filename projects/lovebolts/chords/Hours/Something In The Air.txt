SOMETHING IN THE AIR from Hours

the main points are:

1. from 'your coat...shelf' - there's a pedal G under shifting Cm-ish harmony.
2. "Lived with the best times" - Bb MINOR, not major.
3. this is a notational issue, but all the G#s should be Ab, and all F#s should be Gb.


INTRO:  Gm


Cm/G                  Cm9/G    
Your coat and hat are gone 
Cm/G                        Cm9/G
I really can't look at your little empty shelf
Dm             
A ragged teddy bear
 F               Dm         
It feels like we never had a chance
F
Don't look me in the eye
Cm/G
We lay in each other's arms 
Cm9/G            Cm/G          Cm9/G
But the room is just an empty space
Dm
I guess we lived it out
F
Something in the air
Dm
We smile too fast
F                              Bbm
Then can't think of a thing to say

F/A                      Ab
Lived with the best times
              Eb
Left with the worst

Danced with you too long
Gb              F
Nothing left to save
Bbm                 F/A
Let's take what we can
Ab                      Eb
I know you'll hold your head up high
Gb                  F
We've raged for the last time
Gb              F
A place of no return
                             Bb  F/A
And there's something in the air
             Gm
Something in my eye

I've danced with you too long

Abracadoo, I lose you
Cm9       Cm            Cm9          Dm
We can't avoid the clash, the big mistake

Now we're going to pay and pay
Dm
The sentence of our lives
F                               Cm
Can't believe I'm asking you to go
                Cm9
We used what we could
           Cm            Cm9
To get the things we want
Dm                     F
But we lost each other on the way
Dm               F                               Bb
I guess you know I never wanted anyone more than you

Lived all our best times

Raged for the last time

F#                 F
There's nothing we have to say

There's nothing in our eyes
