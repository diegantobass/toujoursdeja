Of what we have become                                            In your fear
                                                                Seek only love

                                                                Seek only peace
E
All that we are                                                   In your fear
                                                                Seek only love

Rise together                                                     In you fear

Through these clouds                                              In your fear
Ab
As on wings                                                       As on wings
