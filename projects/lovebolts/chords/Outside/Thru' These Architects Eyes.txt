
THRU THESE ARCHITET'S EYES

A
Stomping along
   G/A
on this big Phillip Johnson
  A                      G/A
Is delay just wasting my time
A
Looking across
G/A
at Richard Rogers
A                                 G/A
Scheming dreams to blow both their minds


Bm           
It's difficult you see
Bmsus2
To give up baby
Bm
To leave a job
Bmsus2
When you know
                          A
You know the money's from day to day


CHORUS
A                    Em
All the majesty of a city landscape
D                A(9)
All the soaring days in our lives
A                 Em
All the concrete dreams
in my mind's eye
D                A
All the joy I see
Thru these architect's eyes

Cold winter bleeds
on the girders of Babel
This stone boy watching the crawling land
Rings of flesh and the towers of iron
The steaming caves and the rocks and the sand
Stomping along on this big Phillip Johnson
Is delay just wasting my time


It's difficult you see
To give up baby
These summer scumholes
This goddamned starving life


CHORUS
