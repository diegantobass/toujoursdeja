Spy, spy, pretty girl
                                    D9  Asus2
I see you see me through your window
Don't turn your nose up
                                                        D9  Asus2  D9
Well, you can if you need to, you won't be the first or last


F                                                C
It must strain you to look down so far from your Father's house
      D           C          G         Am                 Am7
And I know what a louse like me in his house could do for you
E                    D      C     G
I'm the Cream of the Great Utopia Dream
    E                       D              C              F C
And you're the gleam in the depths of your banker's spleen

I'm a phallus in pigtails
                            F C
And there's blood on my nose
                        F C
And my tissue is rotting
                            F C
Where the rats chew my bones
       F                Bb F
And my eye sockets empty
                    Bb F
See nothing but pain
       C                     F C
I keep having this brainstorm 
                        F C
About twelve times a day
        G                   A               Bb              C
So now, you could spend the morning walking with me, quite amazed

As I'm Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed

                         F C
I got eyes in my backside
                          F C
That see electric tomatoes
                        F C
On credit card rye bread
                               F C
There are children in washrooms
        F                 Bb F
Holding hands with a queen
                            Bb F
And my heads full of murders
        C                F C  F C
Where only killers scream
       G                   A               Bb             C
So now you could spend the morning talking with me quite amazed

And I'm raving mad and Somewhat Slightly Dazed

                            F C
Now you run from your window
                     F C
To the porcelain bowl
                              F C
And you're sick from your ears
                        F C
To the red parquet floor
        F                 Bb F
And the Braque on the wall
                      Bb F
Slides down your front
    C                      F C
And eats through your belly
                  F C
It's very catching
        G                    A                      Bb            C
So now, you should spend the mornings lying to your Father quite amazed
