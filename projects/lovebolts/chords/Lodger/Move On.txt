Move On- David Bowie 

C#                 F# C#
  Sometimes I feel
                   F# C#
The need to move on
                     G#     C#    
So I pack a bag  and move on
    G#     C#
and Move on
C#                         
Well I might take a train
    F#         C#
Or sail at dawn
  F#          C#
Might take a girl
         G#   C#
When I move on
         G#   C#  G#  B  F#
When I move on

B                    E  
Somewhere, someone's calling me
 F#                     G#m
When the chips are down
  C#                   A#m
I'm just a travelling man
 C#
Maybe it's just a trick of the mind, but
B                   E
Somewhere there's a morning sky
F#                 G#m
 Bluer than her eyes
C#                    A#m 
Somewhere there's an ocean
C#                  C#  G#  B  F#
Innocent and wild
B                   G#m
Africa is sleepy people
Ebm
Russia has its horsemen
E
Spent some nights in old Kyoto
A        E      F#     G#m
Sleeping on the matted ground
B            Ebm
Cyprus is my island
C#               A#m
When the going's rough
E 
I would love to find you
A         E    F#        G#m
Somewhere in a place like that

C#     F# C#     F# C#      G# C# G# B F#

B    E    F#    G#m
C#   A#m  C#    C#
B    E    F#    G#m
C#   A#m  C#    C#

B                    E
Somewhere, someone's calling me
F#                      G#m
When the chips are down
C#                      A#m
I stumble like a blind man
C#
Can't forget you
Can't forget you

B              E
Feeling like a shadow
F#               G#m
Drifting like a leaf
  C#                    A#m
I stumble like a blind man
C#
Can't forget you Can't forget you
                  
B    E    F#    G#m
C#   A#m  
C#                               C#  G#  B  F# Eb7+9
Can't forget you Can't forget you
