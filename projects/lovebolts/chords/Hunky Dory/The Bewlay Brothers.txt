THE BEWLAY BROTHERS from Hunky Dory 


INTRO:  D  Em  A
        D  Em  A...With lead guitar 


           D
And so the story goes they wore the clothes
                                     Em         A
They said the things to make it seem improbable
               D                         Em  A
The whale of a lie like they hope it was
        D
And the good men tomorrow had their feet in the wallow
          Em
And their heads of brawn were nicer shorn
    A                                  D
And how they bought their depositions with saccharin and trust
        Em                      A            D
And the world was asleep to our latent fuss
Em                                         A
Sighing the swirl through the streets like the crust of the sun
       Bm
The Bewlay Brothers
       A                        G
In our wings that bark flashing teeth of brass
         F#
Standing tall in the dark 
F#sus4         Asus2
Oh and we were gone
                       G                          Em
Hanging out with your dwarf men we were so turned on
                   C
By your lack of conclusions


BREAK 1:  D  Em  A


      D                                                             Em
Well, I was stone and he was wax so he could scream and still relax unbelievable
A                           D             Em  A
And we frightened the small children away
        D      
And our talk was old and dust would flow through our veins and lo it was midnight
Em                      A                            D
Back o' the kitchen door like the grim face on the cathedral floor
Em                          A                     D
And the solid book we wrote cannot be found today
Em                                   A                  Bm
And it was stalking time for the moonboys the Bewlay Brothers
           A                      G
With our backs on the arch in the Devil may be here
             F#
But he can't sing about that 
F#sus4         Asus2
Oh and we were gone 
          Gmaj7                     Em                       C
Real cool traders we were so turned on you thought we were fakers


BREAK 2:  D  Em  A


             D
And now that dress is hung the ticket pawned the factor Max that proved the fact
   Em              A                            D    Em  A
Is melted down and woven on the edging of my pillow
       D
Now my brother lays upon the rocks he could be dead he could be not 
   Em                A                               D
He could be you he's chameleon, comedian, corinthian and caricature
Em                     A              D
Shooting up pie in the sky the Bewlay Brothers 
       Em                A           Bm
In the feeble and the bad the Bewlay Brothers
       A                       G
In the blessed and cold in the crutch hungry dark
             F#             
Was where we flayed our mark 
F#sus4     Asus2
Oh we were gone
             Gmaj7                  Em                        C
Kings of oblivion we were so turned on in the mind warp pavillion


Bm               C               F               Bm
Lay me place and bake me pie I'm starving for me gravy
                   C               F                Bm
Leave my shoes and door unlocked I might just slip away, hey
             F                           Bm
Just for the day, hey, hey, please come away, hey 
             F                      Bm
Just for the day, hey, please come away, hey 
             F                 Bm                
Please come away, just for the day
             F                 Bm
Please come away, please come away 
             F                 Bm
Please come away, please come away 
 F     Bm  F  Bm 
Away, away
