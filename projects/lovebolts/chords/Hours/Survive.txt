SURVIVE from Hours 


INTRO:  D9


D      C
Oh, my naked eyes
D                      C
I should have kept you I should have tried
Am                     Em
I should have been a wiser kind of guy
D         G
I miss you
D              C
Give me wings, give me space
D                   C
Give me money for a change of face
Am                Em
Those noisy rooms and passion pants
D          G
I loved you


A                  G
Where's the morning in my life
A                   G
Where's the sense in staying right
A                G
Who said time is on my side
D        D/C#              C
I've got ears and eyes and nothing in my life
Bb
But I'll survive your naked eyes
        D
I'll survive


SOLO:  C  D  C
       Am  Em
       D  G


A        G
You alone across the floor
A             G
You and me and nothing more
A                       G
You're the great mistake I never made
D       D/C#           C
I never lied to you, I hated when you lied
Bb
But I'll survive your naked eyes
        D
I'll survive


D            C
Beatle boys, all snowy white
D                    C
Razzle dazzle clubs, every night
Am            Em
Wish I'd sent a Valentine
D         G
I love you


D             C                D      C
I'll survive, naked eyes, I'll survive
     D        C
I'll survive, my naked eyes
     D      C         D     C
I'll survive, I'll survive, naked eyes
        D   C      D      C
I'll survive, I'll survive
     D      C
I'll survive
