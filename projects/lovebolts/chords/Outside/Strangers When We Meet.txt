Chorus: [E D A]


 
(Yooou, yooou, yooou)
(Yooou, yooou, yooou)

        A
All our friends
             G/A
Now seem so thin and frail
        E
Slinky secrets
                D
Hotter than the sun

No peachy prayers
No trendy rush of faith
I'm with you
So I can't go on

CHORUS
         E
  All my violence
           D		 A
  Raining tears upon the sheet
	  E
  I'm bewildered
            D	              A
  For we're strangers when we meet

Blank screen TV
Preening ourselves in the snow
Forget my name
But I'm over you

Splendid sunrise
And it's a dying world
Humming Rheingold
We scavenge up our clothes

CHORUS
  All my violence
  Raging tears upon the sheets
  I'm resentful
  For we're strangers when we meet

Cold tired fingers
Tapping out your memories
Halfway sadness
Dazzled by the new

Your embrace
It was all that I feared
That whirling room
We trade by vendue

[E	D	A]
Steely resolve
Is falling from me
My poor soul
All bruised passivity
All your regrets
Ride rough-shod over me
I'm so glad
That we're strangers when we meet
I'm so thankful
That we're strangers when we meet
I'm in clover
For we're strangers when we meet
Heel head over
But we're strangers when we meet

D			A
Strangers when we meet 
E			A
Strangers when we meet (repeat ad. inf.)
