CANDIDATE from Diamond Dogs 


INTRO:  Dm  Am  G x5


                Dm             Am
I'll make you a deal, like any other candidate
         G
We'll pretend we're walking home cause your future's at stake
   Dm                      Am
My set is amazing, it even smells like a street
          G
There's a bar at the end where I can meet you and your friend
Dm                                       Am
Someone scrawled on the wall I smell the blood of les tricoteuses
    G
Who wrote up scandals in other bars
           Dm                   Am
I'm having so much fun with the poisonous people
          G
Spreading rumours and lies and stories they made up
Dm                     Am
Some make you sing and some make you scream
G
One makes you wish that you'd never been seen
              Dm                                Am
But there's a shop on the corner that's selling papier mache
       G
Making bullet-proof faces, Charlie Manson, Cassius Clay
       Dm       Am           G
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
       Dm
So you scream out of line
  Am                    G
I want you, I need you, Anyone out there, Any time
Dm                                  Am
Tres butch little number whines hey dirty, I want you
          G
When it's good, it's really good, and when it's bad I go to pieces
Dm              Am           G
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
             Dm                                Am
Well, on the street where you live I could not hold up my head
      G
For I put all I have in another bed
    Dm                   Am
On another floor, in the back of a car
       G
In the cellar of a church with the door ajar
        Dm                             Am
Well, I guess we must be looking for a different kind
             G
But we can't stop trying til we break up our minds
        Dm                     Am
Til the sun drips blood on the seedy young knights
    G
Who press you on the ground while shaking in fright
  Dm                         Am
I guess we could cruise down one more time
     G
With you by my side, it should be fine
      Dm                 Am
We'll buy some drugs and watch a band
     G
Then jump in the river holding hands
