{with riff}

CHORUS 1	D   G Gsus4              D  G Gsus4
                 I'm    waiting for the man
                D           G      Gsus4   D   G Gsus4 
		 Twenty six dollars in my hand
                D                F
		 Up to Lexington, One Two Five
                G                       A 
		 So sick and dirty more dead than alive
                D  G Gsus4              D  G Gsus4
		I'm    waiting for the man

CHORUS 2	Hey white boy, what you doing uptown?
		Hey white boy, you're chasing all the women around
		Oh pardon me sir it's furthest from my mind
		I'm just looking for a good friend of mine
		I'm waiting for the man

CHORUS 3	Here he comes, he's all dressed in black
		PR shoes, and a big straw hat
		He's never early, he's always late
		First thing you learn is that you've always got to wait
		I'm waiting for the man

CHORUS 4	Brown stone building and three flights of stairs
		Nobody stops you 'cause nobody cares
		He's got the works and he gives you sweet taste
		But then you've got to split because you've got no time to waste
		I'm waiting for the man

CHORUS 5	Baby don't you holler, darling don't you scream and shout
		I'm feeling good, I'm going to work it on out
		I'm feeling good, I'm feeling so fine
		Until tomorrow but that's just another time
		I'm waiting for the man
