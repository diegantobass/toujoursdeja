G
She was born in a handbag
F
Love left on a doorstep
G
What she lacks is a backup
F
Nothing seems to make a dent
G
Gonna find her some money honey
F
Try to pay her rent
G
That's the kind of protection
F
everyone is shouting about

First thing she learns is
F
she's a citizen
G
Some things they turn out right
F
When you're under the USA
G
Something rings a bell

and it's all over
G
She's going out her way
F
Stealing for that one good rush

She could use a little money
F
She's hangin' on his arms
G
like a cheap suit
C            Am
She's got no money, honey 
F            G
She's on the other side

She's got a ticket to nowhere
F
She's gonna take a train ride
G
Nobody knows her, or knows her name 
F
She's in the pocket of a home boy
G
Oo she's gonna take her a shotgun Pow
F
Spin the grail spin the drug
G
She's gonna make them well aware
F
She's an angry gal
