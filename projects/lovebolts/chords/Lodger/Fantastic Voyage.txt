D                        E
  In the event that this fantastic voyage
       Gm                     D
Should turn to erosion and we never get old
              E                G
Remember it's true, dignity is valuable
                           D
But our lives are valuable too

A      D                                  A
 We're learning to live with somebody's depression
      D                                    G
And I don't want to live with somebody's depression
              A
We'll get by, I suppose
It's a very modern world, but nobody's perfect
It's a moving world, but that's no reason
To shoot some of those missiles
Think of us as fatherless scum
It won't be forgotten
                                                 D    E
'Cause we'll never say anything nice again, will we?

        Gm
And the wrong words make you listen
        D
In this criminal world
              E                G
Remember it's true, loyalty is valuable
                           D
But our lives are valuable too

A      D                                  A
 We're learning to live with somebody's depression
      D                                    G
And I don't want to live with somebody's depression
             A
We'll get by I suppose
But any sudden movement I've got to write it down
They wipe out an entire race and I've got to write it down
But I'm still getting educated but I've got to write it down
And it won't be forgotten
                                                   D   E   G...
'Cause I'll never say anything nice again, how can I?
