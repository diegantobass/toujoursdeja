WATCH THAT MAN from Aladdin Sane 


INTRO:  G  C9  Em  A
        G  C9  Em  A


A
Shakey threw a party that lasted all night
D
Everybody drank a lot of something nice
             E
There was an old fashioned band of married men
                       F#m
Looking up to me for encouragement it was so-so
    A
The ladies looked bad but the music was sad
D
No one took their eyes off Lorraine
    E
She shimmered and she strolled like a Chicago moll
                               F#m
Her feathers looked better and better it was so-so


D            A                         B                         D
Yeah, it was time to unfreeze when the Reverend Alabaster danced on his knees
D           A             E
Slam, so it wasn't a game cracking all the mirrors in shame


CHORUS:
A     D    G                  D    C
Watch that man oh honey watch that man
         D                              C                     G
Well, he talks like a jerk but he could eat you with fork and spoon
A     D    G                       C
Watch that man oh honey watch that man
   D                          C                       B
He walks like a jerk but he's only taking care of the room
           C
Must be in tune 


INTRO 2:  G  C9  Em  A
          G  C9  Em  A


A
A Benny Goodman fan painted holes in his hands
   D
So shakey hung him up to dry
    E
The pundits were joking the man holes were smoking
                                  F#m
And every bottle battled with the reason why
    A
The girl on the phone wouldn't leave me alone 
  D
A throw back from someones LP
  E
A lemon in a bag played the tiger rag
                                     F#m
And the bodies on the screen stopped bleeding


D          A                         B                          D
Yeah I was shaking like a leaf for I couldn't understand the conversation
D      A                 E
Yeah I ran to the street looking for information


CHORUS 2


G  C9             G  C9
   Watch that man
           G              C9
Watch that man, ooh, ooh, ooh
           G              C9
Watch that man, ooh, ooh, ooh
           G              C9
Watch that man, ooh, ooh, ooh
           G                         C9
Watch that man, ooh, ooh, watch that man
           G               C9
Watch that man, watch that man
           G               C9
Watch that man, watch that man
           G               C9
Watch that man, watch that man
