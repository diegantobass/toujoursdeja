THE LONELIEST GUY from Reality


Intro: Ebm  Bm

Gb               C#
Streets damp and warm
E           Ebm
Empty smell metal
Gb            C#
Weeds between buildings
E              Ebm
Pictures on my hard drive
Bm           Gb
But I'm the luckiest guy
Ab       Bm
Not the loneliest guy

Ebm Bm

(The chord progression is the same for the next verse)

Steam under floor
Shards by the mirror's frame
Clouds green and low
No sign, no nothing now
But I'm the luckiest guy
Not the loneliest guy

Gb      Ab              E
All the pages that have turned
Gb      Ab            E        Ebm
All the errors left unlearned, Oh
Bm          Gb
But I'm the luckiest guy
Ab       Bm
Not the loneliest guy
       Gb    C# E Ebm
In the world
    Bm Ebm
Not me

Bm Ebm

    Bm 
Not me
