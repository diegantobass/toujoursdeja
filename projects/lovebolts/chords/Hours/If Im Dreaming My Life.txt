INTRO:  Gm  Eb  C  F  D
        Gm  Eb  C


        F           Gm
Was she never there was she ever
       F
Was it air she breathed
       Gm
At the wrong time
   F     Gm
Oh oh oh oh
   F     Gm
Oh oh oh oh

        F
All the flowers so
         Gm
From the gallery
         F
With the hymns of night
        Gm
Singing come to me
       Eb
At the wrong time
       F
On the wrong day
        Gm
All the lights are fading now
       F                   Gm  Eb  C
If I'm dreaming all my life


         F
Just one living chance
         Gm
When the Mother sighs
         F
When the Father steps aside
       Gm
At the wrong time
F     Gm
Oh oh oh oh

        F                  Gm
Was she never here was she ever
       F
Was it air she breathed
       Gm
At the wrong time
       Eb
On the wrong day
        F
All the lights are fading now
       Gm
If I'm dreaming all my life
       F
If I'm dreaming all my life
