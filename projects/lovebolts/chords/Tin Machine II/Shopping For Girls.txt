Intro :
E / F / G / F / Em

E                F                     G
Between the dead ring ash of extreme defense
           F                 Em
The lonely groups of company boys
Snapping pictures of scrawny limbs and toothy grins
E                  F      G                      F       
These are children riding naked on their tourist pals
Em
While the hollows that pass for eyes swell from withdrawal
E                F              G
And he lies on a mattress in a rat infested room
F       Em
Talking 'bout his family and the cold back home

A#
Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
G
Noone over here reads the papers pal
       A#
'Tween the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
     C
He's a clean trick and he's shopping for girls

A small black someone jumps over the crazy white guard
Cranking up the volume of a Michael Jackson song

Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
Noone over here reads the papers pal
'Tween the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
He's a clean trick and he's shopping for girls

Where the frangipani scents the air
She mouths a word that breaks his stare
He grunts his reply in a garrulous croak
"That's a mighty big word for a nine year old"

Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
Noone over here reads the papers pal
'Tween the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
He's a clean trick and he's shopping for girls

Shopping for girls, shopping for girls

You gaze down into her eyes for a million miles
You wanna give her a name and a clean rag doll
