E 
Don't look back
G                     C   
Whatever it takes to save your life
Em               G               A         C
I've believed I belonged to you for a long time
G                 A              C       E Stop
And my heart says no, no one but you
E                           G
Like a rescue on a darkened street
                 C
Love walked into town
Em           G            A            C
I-I-I was a victim of my own self-persecution
 A               E             C             E
I'm a prisoner of love-but I'm coming up for air

CHORUS
 G                                 F
  Now don't be fooled by fools who promise you
 G                                 F
  The world and all that glitters more fool you
            G                                 F
I'm such a hungry man that I beg you over and over and over 
      G               F
And I might take any highway to be there with you
 E                               A
Even the best men shiver in their beds
 E              G                C             G      A
I'm loving you above everything I have (AAAAH AAAAH AAAH)
A                     C        G      A     No Chord    E    G   C
I'm a prisoner of love(Aaaaah aaaah aaaah) -just stay square
E                        G
Like a sermon on a blues guitar
    C
Love walked into town
E                 G
I was drowning so slowly
     A                   C
One step in front of your shadow
 A             E               C             E
I'm a prisoner of love but I'm coming up for air

(And so on......)

CHORUS

I smell the sickness sown in this city
It drives me to hide you, yea, even deceive you
I'm so afraid for you  that
I'll break any thug that maps out your passage to ruin
Even the best men shiver in their beds
I'm loving you above everything I have
I'm a prisoner of love-just stay square
