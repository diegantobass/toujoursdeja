Modern Love- David Bowie

D/E  Em
I know when to go out
D/C  C
	And when to stay in
Dsus4                      D/E  Em
	Get things done
C
  I catch a paper boy
                        G
But things don't really change
                    Am
I'm standing in the wind
                     E7   F
But I never wave bye-bye
      C      G       Em7  Em  
But I try, I try

C
  There's no sign of life
                       G
It's just the power to charm
                 Am
I'm lying in the rain
                     E7  F
But I never wave bye-bye
      C      G
But I try, I try

Em7  Em
	Never gonna fall for
C
Modern love - walks beside me
D
Modern love - walks on by
Em                           F
Modern love - gets me to the church on time
C
Church on time - terrifies me
D
Church on time - makes me party
Em                                F
Church on time - puts my trust in God and man
C
God and man - no confessions
D
God and man - no religion
Em                             F
God and man - don't believe in modern love

C
It's not really work
                       G
It's just the power to charm
                          Am
I'm still standing in the wind
                     E7   F
But I never wave bye bye

      C      G   
But I try, I try
