CHORUS:
    G                Em   
So  deep  in  your  room          
    G                Em
you never leave your room
    Am               Am/G              
    Something  deep  inside of me
    F                Em           
       yearning deep inside of me     
   D                   C
is talking through the gloom 
D                C            
     What in the world can you do
D                C
     What in the world can you do  
D                C             
     I'm in the  mood  for  your love
D                C 
                       for your love
D                C                     
                       for your love

              F          Eb
Oh I'm just a little bit afraid of you
      F                   Eb
Cause love won't make you cry
     F              Eb
But, wait until the crowd goes
    F              Eb
    F              Eb
Oh, Wait until the crowd goes
    F              Eb
              F                Eb
I'm just a little bit afraid of you

To be real me, to the real me
          F   Eb           F   Eb           F          Eb
Under the cool,  under the cool and under having a ball
F             Eb           F   Eb         F    Eb
What you gonna say to the real me, to the real me
