INTRO:  Pick slide > E  A


               E                              A
Here comes the night (Ohhhhh... here it comes)
               E
Here comes the night
A                    E    A

                        E    B
Oh, yeah Here comes the night


E                             B
I can see right out my window walking down the street my girl
      E         A  B
With another guy
    E                                       B
His arms around her like it used to be with me
               E          A  B
Oh it makes me want to die


CHORUS 1:
E                  A

Yeah, here comes the night
A                       E     B
Yeah... (here comes the night)

E                                     B
There they go, funny how they look so good together
               E             A  B
Wonder what is wrong with me
E                                 B
Why can't I accept the fact she's chosen him 
           E           A  B
And simply let them be?


CHORUS 2:
        E    A

Oh she's with him they're turning down the lights
B                            E           A  B
Now he's holding her the way I used to do
E                                  B
I can see her closing her eyes and telling him lies

Exactly like she told me too
