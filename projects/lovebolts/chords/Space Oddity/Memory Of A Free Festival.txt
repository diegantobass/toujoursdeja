    G                        Dm7 
The Children of the summer's end
Em                       Am
Gathered in the dampened grass
   Bm                            Bb
We played Our songs and felt the London sky
C                           G
Resting on our hands it was God's land
       C                       G     Dm7
It was ragged and naive it was Heaven


G                          Dm7
Touch, We touched the very soul
   Em                     Am
Of holding each and every life
   Bm                         Bb   
We claimed the very source of joy ran through
   C                          G
It didn't, but it seemed that way
  C                           G  Eb  C
I kissed a lot of people that day


C              C/B  
Oh, to capture just one drop 
   C7           Am7                Dm  
Of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon
   G                F              C
To paint that love upon a white balloon
                    C/B             C7      
And fly it from the toppest top of all the tops 
     Am7              Dm
That man has pushed beyond his brain
  G            F                  C      
Satori must be something just the same
 
   D                      Dmaj7
We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes 
    D7              D6              G6 
And saw machines of every shape and size
   A                  G               D   
We talked with tall Venusians passing through
                   Dmaj7
And Peter tried to climb aboard 
        D7                D6         
But the Captain shook his head
     G6       
And away they soared
A                    G             D
Climbing through the ivory vibrant cloud
A                   G               D
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd
       A                  G  
And We walked back to the road, unchained


WEIRD BIT


    D              C                      G                   D
The sun machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party, ah ah ah
    D              C                      G                   D
The sun machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party, ah ah ah
    D              C                      G                   D
The sun machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party, ah ah ah
    D              C                      G                   D
The sun machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party, ah ah ah

Repeat until fade out...
