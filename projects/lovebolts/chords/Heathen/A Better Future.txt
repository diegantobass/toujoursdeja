David Bowie
"A Better Future"
Heathen


G#
Please don't tear this world asunder
G#
Please take back this fear we're under
Bbm
I demand a better future
Eb
Or I might just stop wanting you
I might just stop wanting you

G#
Please make sure we get tomorrow
G#
All this pain, all this sorrow
Bbm
I demand a better future
Eb
Or I might just stop needing you
I might just stop needing you

G#
Give my children sunny smiles
G#
Give them warm and cloudless skies
Bbm
I demand a better future
Eb
Or I might just stop loving you
I might just stop loving you, loving you

G#
When you talk
We talk too
Bbm
When you walk
We walk too
Eb
From factory to field
G#
How many tears must fall
Eb
Down here below
Bbm
Nothing is moving

G#
I might just stop wanting you
Bbm
I might just stop needing you
Eb
I might just stop loving you
G#
I demand a better future
G#
I demand a better future
Bbm
I demand a better future
Eb
For I might just stop loving you
Loving you, loving you

G#
I demand a better future
G#
I demand a better future
Bbm
I demand a better future
Eb
Or I might just stop loving you
Loving you, loving you

G#
I demand a better future
