This is not America, sha la la la la
A little piece of you
A little peace in me
Will die (This is not a miracle)
For this is not America

Blossom fails to bloom this season
Promise not to stare
Too long (This is not America)
For this is not the miracle

There was a time
A storm that blew so pure
For this could be the biggest sky
That I could have the faintest idea

(For this is not America, sha la la la la, sha la la la la, sha la la la la
This is not America, no, this is not, sha la la la la)

Snowman melting from the inside
Falcon spirals to the ground (This could be the biggest sky)
So bloody red
Tomorrow's plans

A little piece of you
The little piece in me
Will die (This could be a miracle)
For this is not America

There was a time
A wind that blew so young
For this could be the biggest sky
And I could have the faintest idea

(For this is not America, sha la la la la, sha la la la la, sha la la la la
This is not America, no, this is not, sha la la la
This is not America, no, this is not
This is not America, no, this is not, sha la la la)
