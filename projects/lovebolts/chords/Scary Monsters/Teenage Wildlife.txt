     G#                       C#
Well,how come you only want tomorrow

    G#                               C#
With its promise of something hard to do

     G#                               D#
A real life adventure worth more than pieces of gold

F#                                      C#                    G#
Blue skies above and sun on your arms strength in your stride

             D#
And hope in those squeaky clean eyes

 F#
You'll get chilly receptions everywhere you go

C#                    G#          D#
Blinded with desire - guess the season is on

        G#                                              C#
So you train by the shadow boxing, search for the truth

But it's all, but it's all used up

    G#
Break open your million dollar weapon

               C#
And push your luck, still you push, still you push your luck

   G#
A broken nosed mogul are you

            D#
One of the new wave boys

 F#
Same old thing in brand new drag

 C#                 G#     D#
Comes sweeping into view, oh-ooh

  F#
As ugly as a teenage millionaire

   C#                        G#
Pretending it's a whizz kid world

                D#
You'll take me aside, and say

      C#           cm
"well David, what shall I do?"

      bm            G#
They wait for me in the hallway"

         C#        cm          bm        G#
I'll say "dont ask me, I don't know any hallways"

         C#        cm                bm       G#
But they move in numbers and they've got me in a corner

   A#
I feel like a group of one,no-no

      C#
They can't do this to me

    A#                        G#              C# 
I'm not some piece of teenage wildlife

      F#                     Fm                      D# 
Those midwives to history put on their bloody robes 

    F#                             Fm                  D#
The word is that the hunted one is out there on his own 

    F#
You're alone for maybe the last time

And you breath for a long time

                     
Then you howl like a wolf in a trap

And you daren't look behind

 Fm                            D#
You fall to the ground like a leaf from the tree

    G#                       C#
And look up one time at the vast blue sky

  bm                        
Scream out aloud as they shoot you down

    C#    bm                        G#        C#
No no, I'm not a piece of teenage wildlife

                              G#   C# G# D# F# C# G# D#
I'm not a piece of teenage wildlife

     C#              cm        bm        G#    
And no one will have seen and no on will confess

     C#              cm              bm           G#        
The fingerprints will prove that you couldn't pass  the test 

      C#          cm            bm                G#               
There'll be others on the line filing past, who'll whisper low 

bm
I miss you he really had to go
C#
Well each to his own, he was

                         G#                   C#
