Ricochet
Lyrics and music by David Bowie

A   A

D                        G
Like weeds on a rockface waiting for the scythe 
    Ab         A
Ricochet - ricochet
    D                    G
The world is on a corner waiting for jobs 
    D          G
Ricochet - ricochet
              E                         A
Turn the holy pictures so they face the wall
A
And who can bear to be forgotten
A
And who can bear to be forgotten



A
March of flowers, march of dimes
A
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
A
Men wait for news while thousands are still asleep
A
Dreaming of tramlines factories pieces of machinery
A
Mine shafts things like that
A
March of flowers, march of dimes
A
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
A
Sound of thunder, sound of gold
A
Sound of the devil breaking parole
E
Ricochet - it's not the end of the world



D 
Sound of thunder, sound of gold
G
Sound of the devil breaking parole 
    E          A 
Ricochet - ricochet
D
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
G
Teaching life in a violent new way 
    D          G
Ricochet - ricochet
              E                         A
Turn the holy pictures so they face the wall

A
And who can bear to be forgotten
A
And who can bear to be forgotten



A
March of flowers, march of dimes
A
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
A
Early, before the sun, they struggle off to the gates
A
In their secret fearful places they see their lives
A
Unravelling before them
A
March of flowers - march of dimes
A 
Sound of thunder, sound of gold
A
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
A
Sound of the devil breaking parole
E
Ricochet it's not the end of the world


A
But when they get home, damp eyed and weary
They smile and crush their children to their heaving chests
Making unfulfillable promises
For who can bear to be forgotten
