The television's on but I'm

walking through the yard
G#
The house is fast asleep and IÂ´m
F#			C#
crying in my car

Dying for the weekend

don't smile much
G#
They're set up in the garage with their
F#			C#
decks and their stuff

The boy's on a charge, but his

mother doesn't know
G#
I never got around yet to 
F#		C#
telling her so
(F#) 			C#
It would only make her crazy

I'm only screaming in my head
A
But I can fly
A
I close my eyes
	C#
And I can fly
