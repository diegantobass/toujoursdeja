it's a trill pick while sliding down the E string, and a quick little 
lick on the D string, a guitar that's mega-distorted plays an A chord 
before this part, but it's really far away in the mix.

the "i'm already ..." part is just chords: G A D (right before the "i 
think i've lost my way..." part.)

There's always the Diamond friendly
Sitting in the Laugh Hotel
The hearts filthy lesson
With her hundred miles to hell

Oh, Ramona - if there was only something between us
If there was only something between us
Other than our clothes

Something in our sky
Something in our sky
Something in our blood
Something in our sky

Paddy
Paddy
Who's been wearing Miranda's clothes?

It's the hearts filthy lesson
Hearts filthy lesson
Hearts filthy lesson
Falls upon deaf ears
(Hearts Filthy Lesson)
It's the hearts filthy lesson
Hearts filthy lesson
Hearts filthy lesson
Falls upon deaf ears
Falls upon dead ears

(Hearts filthy lesson)
Oh Ramona, if there was only some kind of future
Oh Ramona, if there was only some kind of future
And these cerulean skies

Something in our skies
Something in our skies
Something in our blood
Something in our skies

Paddy, Paddy?

Paddy will you carry me, I think I've lost my way
(Hearts filthy lesson)
I'm already five years older I'm already in my grave
(Hearts filthy lesson)
I'm already
I'm already
I'm already
(Hearts filthy lesson, hearts filthy lesson)
Will you carry me?
Oh Paddy, I think I've lost my way

Paddy, what a fantastic death abyss
Paddy, what a fantastic death abyss
(Hearts filthy lesson)
It's the hearts filthy lesson
Tell the others
(Hearts filthy lesson)
It's the hearts filthy lesson
What a fantastic death abyss
Tell the others
(Hearts filthy lesson)
It's the hearts filthy lesson
Paddy, what a fantastic death abyss
(Hearts filthy lesson)
It's the hearts filthy lesson
Tell the others
