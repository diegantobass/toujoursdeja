ALABAMA SONG

F7/C
Oh, show me the way
to the next whiskey bar

Cdim/C-B-C    A6/C#
Oh, don't ask why

Cdim/C-B-C    A6/C#
No, don't ask why

F7/C
For we must find
next whiskey bar
Or if we don't find the next whiskey bar


Cdim/C-B-C    A6/C#
I tell you we must die

Cdim/C-B-C    A6/C#
I tell you we must die

I tell you
I tell you        A6/C#     D     Ddim
I tell you we must die

Oh, Moon of Alabama
     Em          Edim

our good ol' mama

Oh, you know why
    G          Bm
Oh, Moon of Alabama
      Em             Edim
It's time to say goodbye

We've lost
             Em
our good ol' mama
D
I must have whiskey
             G6
Oh, you know why
