CHANGES from Hunky Dory 


INTRO: Cmaj7  Dbadd6  Dm7  Eb7  
       F  D  F  D 


C			      Em
I still don't know what I was waiting for
       F		G
And my time was running wild
	  F
A million dead end streets
C			 Em
Every time I thought I'd got it made 
	      F		       G
It seemed the taste was not so sweet 
     Cmaj7    Dm7	   Em7  Ebm7
So I turned myself to face me
    Dm7			        G
But I've never caught a glimpse
	   Cmaj7       Dm7	 Em7  Ebm7
Of how the others must see the faker
	     Dm7		   
I'm much too fast to take the test


CHORUS:
G 	 F
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
C	 C/B	  C/A
Turn and face the strange
	C/G
Ch-ch-changes
F     F/E		  D
Don't want to be a richer man
G	 F
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
C	 C/B	  C/A
Turn and face the strange
	C/G
Ch-ch-changes
F    F/E		D
It's gonna have to be a different man
F    C   Bb     F      C G     F     C
Time may change me but I can't trace time


C		      Em
I watched the ripples change there size
    F		       G	     F
But never leave the stream of warm impermanence
   C		      Em
And so the days float thru my eyes 
	      F		    G
But still the days seem the same
	  Cmaj7	   Dm7	    Em7
And these children that you spit on
   Ebm7 Dm7		    G
As they try to change their worlds
	Cmaj7	   Dm7       Em7
Are immune to your consultations
Ebm7		Dm7
They're quite aware of what they're going thru


CHORUS 2:
G 	 F
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
C	 C/B	  C/A
Turn and face the strange
	C/G
Ch-ch-changes
F     F/E		  D
Don't want to be a richer man
G	 F
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
C	 C/B	  C/A
Turn and face the strange
	C/G
Ch-ch-changes
F		   F/E			    D
Where's your shame you've left us up to our necks in it
F    C   Bb     F      C G     F     C    F C 
Time may change me but I can't trace time


F			 C	    F  C
Strange fascination, fascinate me
   F	  		  G
Oh changes are taking the pace I'm going thru


CHORUS 3:
G 	 F
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
C	 C/B	  C/A
Turn and face the strange
	C/G
Ch-ch-changes
F     F/E		  D
Don't want to be a richer man
G	 F
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
C	 C/B	  C/A
Turn and face the strange
	C/G
Ch-ch-changes

Pretty soon now your gonna get older
F    C   Bb     F      C G     F     C
Time may change me but I can't trace time
	    F    C   Bb	    F	   C G	   F	 C
I said that time may change me but I can't trace time


OUTRO:  Dm7  Em7  Eb7  Dm7  Dbm7  Cmaj7

-----------------------------------------
INTRO AND OUTRO: This song is fairly difficult to play on guitar. I don't think 
there is any actual guitar in the record. When they performed it live Bowie used 
to strum an acoustic and Ronson would come in on the chorus with overdrive and 
beef it up just by playing the C major run down. The piano chords behind the sax 
outro and the intro don't transpose to guitar very easily. Playing some of the 
chords in different positions may help, like for example all as barres...

       EADGBE
       ------
Cmaj7  X3545X
Db7    X4646X
Dm7    X5756X
Eb7    X6868X

You'll notice I've substituted a Db7 for the Dbadd6. It still sounds alright. 
It's much easier to play like this. It also sounds better if you don't sound the 
whole chords. Only the four middle strings. The high E string doesn't seem to 
fit into that intro for some reason! 


MAIN RIFF: The 'F' and 'D' bit with the saxophone playing. Live Mick Ronson used 
to do it instead, with balls. So here are the notes:

	  D        F
	E-------------------
	B-------------------
	G-----2242-22222222-
	D-0034-----33333333-
	A----------33333333-
	E----------11111111-


The actual run is played over the 'D' chord and the 'F' chord is stabbed 
afterwards.


SAX OUTRO: Here it is transcribed for guitar as well as I could, but take 
into consideration, different instruments don't always come across too well on 
the guitar: 
	  C  Dm7      Em7  Eb7      Dm7  Dbmaj7  Cmaj7
	E--------------------------------------------
	B--------------------------------------------
	G--------------------------------------------
	D-------------75-----------------3-2-3-2-3-2-
	A-35775H7P535---75365H6P535-6535-------------
	E--------------------------------------------

The phrasing and timing will have to be left up to your ears and nimble fingers, 
but all the notes are there for ya!
