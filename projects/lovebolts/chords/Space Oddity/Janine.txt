JANINE from Space Oddity 


INTRO:  D  C  G C D
        D  C  G C D
        D  C  G C D


                       F#m               G
Oh my love, Janine I'm helpless for your smile
E                        A           G               D
Like a Polish wanderer I travel ever onwards to your land
            A                G                     F#m
And were it not just for the jewels I'd close your hand
     D                 F#m          G
Your strange demand to collocate my mind
E                                 A
Scares me into gloom you're too intense
             G                D
I'll have to keep you in your place
          A                 G                  F#m
I've no defence I've got to keep my veil on my face


CHORUS 1:
  D                   C               G
Janine, Janine, you'd like to know me well
    C                 G
But I've got things inside my head
     F            C
That even I can't face
  D                   C                 G
Janine, Janine, you'd like to crash the walls
    C              G
But if you take an axe to me
       F            C             
You'll kill another man not me at all


INTRO


                      F#m            G
You're fey, Janine, a trooper to the last
    E                             A
But if I catch you standing on my toes
            G                  D
I'll have a right to shout you down 
             A              G                       F#m
For you're a lazy stream in which my thoughts would drown
   D                F#m           G
So stay, Janine and we can glide along
     E
I've caught your wings for laughs
         A                  G                 D
I'm not obliged to read you statements of the year
             A               G               F#m
So take your glasses off and don't act so sincere


CHORUS 1


INTRO until fade
